It's not that it's a bad film (it isn't), but it's because the style is so unlike the rest of his work and the film is amazingly slow. The casual viewer might easily give up early on, as it is a difficult film to love. But, if you are able to get past this, it's a very rewarding film.This film is set in remote areas of the far Eastern portion of Russia about a decade before the Revolution. A group of soldiers have been sent there to explore and document the region and it's clear that they are a bit out of their element in the bleak steppes. Fortunately for the men, they meet up with a nomad named 'Dersu Uzala'--a guy who has wandered this region his entire life. I say fortunate because Uzala has a lot of experience and wisdom. His know-how is able to save the men and aid their journey repeatedly. The contrast between the man and the rest of the group is striking--and not just for the physical differences between them but because of Uzala's unusual animistic beliefs. And, when Uzala leaves to go his own way, the men are sad to see him go and are filled with admiration for this odd but likable man. Fortunately, he does return later and once again, his wisdom saves the men on repeated occasions.Later, the Captain from the expedition brings Uzala home with him. However, Uzala cannot cope with the city--it is just too foreign. It's obvious he's miserable and wants to return to the East. Uzala leaves and soon he's found dead--and the film ends on a very sad note.The film definitely has scope and you can't help but admire Kurosawa and his Russian-Japanese crew. They obviously spent a lot of time on this movie and braved many tough days in the snow and rain. In many ways, it's reminiscent of the Lewis and Clark Expedition that explored much of the US in the very early 19th century. Like the Russians, Lewis and Clark also found a native who assisted them...much like Uzala.One final note. This film is based on a book written by a member of this actual team of explorers. Yes, he was a real trapper and the story was also filmed in 1961.\",\"1\":\"Another Kurosawa film about the friendship between two men, with a crucial difference - this is a Russian film with a mostly Russian cast, the only movie that Kurosawa made outside of his home country. It's glacially paced but beautifully shot, the red-tinted landscapes a character all of their own, and the performances are subdued and naturalistic. Not one for those looking for pomp, energy and splendour, but if you're in the right languid mood, it does the trick.\",\"2\":\"It's 1902. Russian army explorer Captain Arseniev leads an expedition into the Siberian wilderness. They encounter local native hunter Dersu Uzala and recruit him as their guide.It's a Soviet film made by the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. I'm not sure how that happened. Quite frankly, I watched the first hour without knowing about Kurosawa and was going to write that this is the best filmmaking out of the Soviet Union. The movie is over two hours and it does need to find a road map for their journey. I'm not saying that it lacks direction. It has an emotional direction. It's about the two men's relationship. I would like for more scenes of the two of them alone. They should have more heart to heart dialogue. Dersu is a great character. For example, I love the grass shelter and the two men are alone in survival mode. I'm also surprised by the tiger. The second half holds some interesting surprises. This is an interesting page in a legend's work. It won an Oscar.\",\"3\":\"In 1902, a Russian army expedition is assigned to explore Siberia under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin). He befriends the Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) and invites him to guide the explorers through the stark forest up to Khanka Lake. Along their journey, Arseniev discovers that Dersu Uzala is a man with a beautiful soul and they become close friends. When his assignment ends, Dersu Uzala says goodbye to Arseniev. In 1907, Captain Arseniev is assigned for another expedition to the Ussuri River; when he meets Dersu Uzala in the forest, the lonely hunter joins his team and guides the group. However, he is older and has problems with his vision and Captain Arseniev invites Dersu Uzala to live with his family in Khabarovsk City. But the old man does not adapt to the urban lifestyle and decides to return to the forest. In 1910, Captain Arseniev is called to Korfovska\\u00efa to identify the body of a man that has his calling card and might be Dersu Uzala.\\\"Derzu Uzala\\\" is a simple and unforgettable tale of friendship between a Russian Captain and a lonely hunter with a beautiful soul. This wonderful movie has one of the most beautiful cinematographies I have ever seen and the camera work is impressive, with awesome angle and locations that seems to be of pictures in movement. I had watched most of Akira Kurosawa movies and I do not know how I could forget to see this magnificent must-see movie of his amazing cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\"\",\"4\":\"I fully expected to find reviews of \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" here that mentioned how slow and boring it was. It didn't take long to run across a handful without even trying. But sometimes the best films involve the simple things in life, and this was one of those pictures. Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) is the name of a wandering Russian hermit who lives in the mountains of Siberia, supporting himself by hunting with little or no money in his pocket. He favors this solitary lifestyle, and somewhat uncharacteristically, agrees to become a guide for a Russian survey team headed by Captain Arsenev (Yuriy Solomin). He quickly finds favor with the small survey team during the the summer of 1902. Little by little, we learn that his wife and two children were killed by smallpox, and his despondency drove him to burn his meager home down and take to the wilderness to contemplate his existence. As a master of all things involving nature, he constantly astounds his travel companions with observations all but invisible to the casual eye, and more than once his insight saves the men from peril. In Part One of the story, Dersu eventually takes his leave of the Captain to go his own way, as the survey team heads back to their respective homes.Part Two finds Captain Arsenev back in the Ussuri region of Siberia a few years later, where he meets up again with his old friend and guide, and they resume their woodland trekking and surveying together. However the aged hunter is gradually losing his eyesight and can no longer rely on being the marksman with a rife that he used to be. Wounding a tiger, Dersu laments the idea that the animal will suffer until it dies, and fears that the woodland spirit Kongnga will send another tiger to kill him in retaliation. The Captain, by now a loyal and trusted friend, invites Dersu to come back to his home town and live with him and his family. For a short time this arrangement works, however the ways of civilized society restrict Dersu to such a degree that he must return to his mountains in order to live and breathe.The poignancy of the story reaches a crescendo when Captain Arsenev is informed of Dersu's passing, He arrives as his long time friend is about to be buried in the cold, Russian wilderness where he was found. The strength of the film lies in the friendship that developed between these two men of such diverse backgrounds, neither of which could survive exclusively in the world of the other. For fans of director Akira Kurosawa, this is not typical of one of his better known Japanese movies, and the only one he filmed outside of his home country. The languid pace will not appeal to all viewers, and I think it might fare better with older film fans like myself who can appreciate a slower paced story telling style without the need for constant action. The harsh environment of the Siberian wilderness complements the story in the way it forces the principals to rely on each other for survival, and in that respect, almost becomes a character in it's own right.\",\"5\":\"Akira Kurosawa's breathtaking \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" looks at a meeting of cultures in pre-revolutionary Russia, as a captain in the czar's army befriends a hunter in Russia's far east. Even as Dersu helps the platoon negotiate the forest and tundra, it is clear that his way of life is dying out as the Russian Empire expands and swallows the indigenous peoples of northeast Asia.The movie has some of the most amazing cinematography. I wouldn't expect a Kurosawa movie to be anything except great, but this movie has to be seen to be believed. There is no description that I can give that will do \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" justice. It is one of the movies that you must see before you die.\",\"6\":\"The Russian army sends an explorer (Yury Solomin) on an expedition to the snowy Siberian wilderness where he makes friends with a seasoned local hunter (Maxim Munzuk).In 1971, in true samurai fashion, Kurosawa attempted suicide due to a bad moment of his career, questioning his creative ability after the commercial failure of \\\"Dodes'ka-den\\\" the year before, and the subsequent denial of funds for his productions by Japanese studios. Luckily, he survived.How crazy this is. Apparently he had wanted to adapt the story to a Japanese setting, but ended up with the original Russian tale with Russian actors and crew. Did Kurosawa speak Russian? Did they speak Japanese? The sheer logistics of bringing this production to fruition is impressive.\",\"7\":\"From director Akira Kurosawa (Ikiru, Seven Samurai), this Russian film featuring in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die was one that sounded like an interesting watch, I was surprised some critics only gave it three out of five stars and more sources give it higher praise, so I was interested which opinion I would gain. Basically, set in 1902, an army of Russian soldiers are on an expedition and under the command of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomin) they are assigned to explore Siberia, and as they trek through the forests they meet Goldi (Nanai) hunter Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk). Captain Arseniev becomes good friends with Dersu Uzala and he is invited to become the guide for the explorers to tread through the forest to Khanka Lake, and as they continue their journey the Captain finds his new friend has a beautiful soul. One time the two friends are caught in open space where the temperature will drop dramatically, and they only have a field of straw that they can cut down and use to make shelter, and after they survive this the hunter says goodbye to move on. Five years pass, and the army are assigned to head for the Ussuri River for another expedition, and Captain Arseniev is happy to meet up with Dersu Uzala again in the forest, and he once again joins them to become guide for the group, but he is much older and his eyesight has become problematic. The Captain invites the hunter to Khabarovsk City to live with his family so they can look after him for a while, but the old man finds it very difficult to adapt to an urban lifestyle, so he returns to life in the forest,l and as a parting gift he gives his friend a new weapon, a rifle. Five years later in Korfovska\\u00efa the body of a man has been brought in and Captain Arseniev is called to identify it, they only have a calling card as any indication of his identity, they are sure it may be Dersu Uzala, he confirms it is and that he must have been killed for the weapon. Also starring Aleksandr Pyatkov as Olenin, Vladimir Kremena as Turtwigin, Suimenkul Chokmorov as Jan Bao, Svetlana Danilchenko as Anna Arseniev and Dmitri Korshikov as Vova. Solomin gives a nice gentle performance as the leader of the small army group, but Munzuk almost steals the show with his wonderfully wise and charismatic performance as the wild hunter who has great knowledge for survival techniques, I can sort of agree that there are shots where we are looking at something for a period of time, like a field, snowy places or forest trees, but I think these moments are interesting besides the action sequences and whatever, I found it a great poetic period drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Very good!\",\"8\":\"For a variety of reasons (that are well known in the darker period of the director's history at this time), Akira Kurosawa left Japan to make a film in Russia (Siberia to be exact). Instead of an epic action picture, he went to one of his other passions as a storyteller- the drama of pure humanity (like Ikiru and Red Beard, this film follows in that vein). The film runs two hours and twenty minutes, but it is a kind of epic story, that does have that pulse of adventure from his other films. But this time he combines that method of a big, spacious environment in the wild with a deep character study. His craftsmanship as a 'painter' of the frame is top-notch as always (all pretensions aside, he is one of the masters at finding the textures and moods in a scene's look as in its character and action), and the use of locations brings a quality that directors today would brush aside with via special and visual effects. Simply put, it is one of, if not the, ultimate testaments to man vs\\/with nature, with a character that remains one of the most memorable that Kurosawa's envisioned.To give an idea of who Dersu Uzala is to someone who hasn't seen the film, picture Yoda without the ability to lift objects with his mind and to kick ass with a light-saber, but still contains all of the direct wisdom and strength that make him one with his surroundings (and, as well, uses his own kind of 'force' for knowledge and defense, and for attack as an ultimately final resort). As a lonesome hunter and drifter with a family tragically lost, Dersu comes upon a team of explorers led by Captain Aseniev (Yuri Solomon, not the best performance but sturdy enough to sustain the physical scenes). He goes along with them as a guide of the sights and smells and feelings that the others just can't sense (out of lack of experience). Aseniev and Dersu end up becoming friends as they brace a torrid windstorm over a bare, wintry landscape, as Kurosawa brings out one of his towering sequences (topping anything David Lean could've drummed up for sure).It's always of interest to me to see characters doing things on screen, having to go against the elements that almost dwarf them in the face of nature (i.e. Cast Away's hour and a half second act). Dersu Uzala seems to be of few words and mostly actions, and soon gains respect and admiration after an odd introduction to the team- he shoots with a keener than keen eye, he spots tracks, he sets up protection in the harshest of conditions, and is always a step ahead of the pack. And bringing all this out is actor Maksim Munzuk, who appears here (like Falconetti in Passion of Joan of Arc) in the performance of a lifetime out of an otherwise obscure and small career. Munzuk never brings anything to Dersu that isn't in his character, and he makes at least a quarter of the film's success a reality (the other three-quarters could be attributed to Kurosawa alone). He can be tough, smart, funny (in an off-beat way), and if nothing else, humble. But more than anything, Munzuk makes Dersu seem alive in a way no other actor could've accomplished, and also brings out the better in Solomon's performance.The story itself has a superb appeal most of the way, but it is in it's last act that 'Derzu Uzala' reaches an intensely tragic plane. Dersu does something (which I won't reveal here and has been discussed elsewhere on the message board) that brings great shame to his own self-worth. In this part of the film, Kurosawa brings out what can be said to be some of the saddest moments in any of his work, however not without logic. While it was likely a major dramatic function in the novel, Kurosawa doesn't just throw these last twenty minutes or so to let steam flow out of the picture. I sensed something almost cathartic about these scenes, that rose the qualities of the rest of the story to a higher level, to one of almost spiritual in nature. It's hard to really pin-point to one who has not seen the film (and, indeed, I have seen the film all of one time). But once its over, you may feel you have seen a work far more rewarding than imaginable- even in awe.\",\"9\":\"Spoilers herein.Kurosawa's genius was in envisioning a story in visual terms, then translating that through masterful framing, and direction of actors. Along the way, he became an absolute master of editing -- editing each day's shoot that night. And he invented a vocabulary of multiplanar storytelling with often three planes of action flattened by his telephoto lens.Then, success crept in, and his studio forced him to make more and more samurai pictures with plots not conceived in his mind. These are still wonderfully photographed, but you can see that the narrative itself wasn't fertilized in his visual imagination. That integration of visual narrative and the various production skills was broken, most clearly with `Red Beard,' and the realization led to collapse, a suicide attempt, and a long, long crawl back to `Ran,' possibly the most narratively integrated film in existence.Along the way, he went through a new apprenticeship and this film is one of the tests he endured. It has one of the Kurosawa master touches: it has an abstract, intelligent, sometimes beautiful camera. But it lacks nearly all of the other elements that add to the hypnotizing mastery of his earlier, integrated efforts:--he had no control over the story, which is quite second-rate and ordinarily conceived (meaning it is literary like Tolstoy and not visual like Tarkovsky)--he could not edit at night because of the cumbersomeness of the 70mm process and the insistence on using remote, Soviet processing labs--he had to work in a language that is not only different, it is profoundly so: Japanese phrases have a staccato rhythm that builds with an emphasis on the end. This is something Kurosawa uses to project to the next scene, or cut within the scene. Russian is a matter of lingual brushes that peak in midphrase and tail off. Each phrase has its own arc, its own closure that one cannot use to sew continuity between utterances. (There is the whole matter of noh gestures as well, but the structure of phrase is more basic and leverageable.) --he was forced to live in an `open' environment.This last is the primary test of this film (which incidentally bears fruit in `Ran'). Hitherto, all of his visual compositions were a matter of manipulating physical constraints to `contain' the frame. He would use buildings to frame village scenes and valley tree and rock elements to frame wilderness (the best of which are `Hidden Fortress'). `High and Low' is an exercise in inside\\/outside constraints, but always constraints. Here he is faced with an openness, where the openness is the unescapable soul of the environment. How to frame and focus when all his framing and compositional tools are unavailable? You shoot from the inside out, rather than the outside in as is traditional in all Japanese art.Lots of this film is unsure experiments in managing this new visual cosmology. The running along the bank of the rapids and the waking up in the emergency grass yurt were irresistably with the old eye for instance. But the lost wandering on the lake bed is an example of him struggling for a coherent frame. There is not a tree, nothing at all. So see how he uses nothing as a constraint, and he shifts that nothing of the open air to the surrounding grass sometimes when they frantically cut it. Framing with open space. See how he plays with this space constraining the fabric constraining the men in the opening of `Ran.'Its a painful journey, this film, not a joy, often tearful for us as we participate.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.\",\"10\":\"Akira Kurosawa's 1974 Russian film about man and nature has been sitting on my shelf for years and I finally got around to watching it.The story, told in flashback of a Russian Captain's encounters with a Monoglian hunter named Dersu Uzala as he makes several mapping trips into Siberia.This is a very good film. I would like to report that its a great film but its not. I enjoyed it but to me the story was lacking, I wanted to know more. I also had problems with the second half of the film which seemed to be straining to go into a man made direction instead of one that flowed naturally.The first half flows. I was just going to take a peak at the film only to find that 45 minutes had passed as if in a blink of an eye. The second half of the film is less natural, it moves in fits toward a conclusion we know from the outset of the film, but which is arrived at via a journey that doesn't seem natural. (the events are fine, its the foreshadowing and thrust to the end that doesn't work.) Technically this is a beautiful film... The march across the ice under a red setting sun is now one of my favorite images..Don't get me wrong, I like the movie but I don't love it.If you get a chance to see it please do so its a wonderful film, that simply disappointed me in the second half.\",\"11\":\"The 1970s was not a particularly happy decade for Akira Kurosawa, Japan's foremost film director. It started with his being taken off of helming the Japanese sequences for the ambitious U.S.\\/Japan co-production of TORA! TORA! TORA! (1970), was followed by the critical and box-office disappointment of his first film to be shot in color \\u0096 DODES'KA-DEN (1970) \\u0096 and culminated in a horrible wrist-slashing suicide attempt which, thankfully, failed! All of this, however, ensured the consequent dissolution of a recently-formed partnership with other major Japanese film-makers \\u0096 namely Kon Ichikawa, Keinosuke Kinoshita and Masaki Kobayashi.It's not all that surprising, then, that Kurosawa wandered off to Russia for his next venture \\u0096 but it is doubly ironic that his sole work away from his home-ground and made during such a lean creative period would eventually win him the Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award! Among the other contenders for that honor were Dino Risi's SCENT OF A WOMAN and Andrzej Wajda's PROMISED LAND, but it was this slow-moving adventure \\u0096 redeemed by its stunning visual splendor (in spite of the color fluctuation in the battered Kino print I watched!) \\u0096 which emerged triumphant.Not top-flight Kurosawa, then, but generally compelling nevertheless and providing a good balance between his trademark humanism (although the majority of the Russians are tritely depicted as fun-loving and rather immature) and action (a scuffle with bandits, a river rescue, a tiger hunt). The best sequence in the entire film is a spectacular blizzard which bonds together trapper\\/guide Dersu Uzala (remarkably played by Maxim Munzuk) and the narrating Russian captain (Yuri Solomin).This clash of cultures, therefore, turns into a celebration of friendship with its succession of dramatic, poignant, even humorous vignettes. Dersu's incompatibility with modern civilization \\u0096 an oft-used device during this particular era in cinema \\u0096 brings to mind THE ENIGMA OF KASPAR HAUSER (1975) and THE ELEPHANT MAN (1980); curiously, all three films were inspired by real events (DERSU UZALA being based on his companion Vladimir Andreyev's memoirs, and which had been adapted for TV during the previous decade).By the way, knowing George Lucas' fondness for Kurosawa, the amiable and pint-sized titular character here \\u0096 who has an awkward way with words but displays infinite wisdom throughout \\u0096 may well have inspired the puppet Yoda from the \\\"Star Wars\\\" saga! Curiously enough, the film itself was distributed in the U.S. by none other than Roger Corman's New World company!!\",\"12\":\"In 1902 a Russian army officer and his squad are tasked with exploring and mapping a remote part of Siberia. On their travels they meet a local hunter, Dersu Uzala, an old man determined to live his life in isolation. At their request he becomes their guide and over time a friendship forms between the officer and Dersu.A very un-Kurosawaesque Akira Kurosawa film. For one it's filmed in Russia, in Russian. Based on a true story, Kurosawa had wanted to make this film since the 1950s but struggled to adapt it to a Japanese setting. Ultimately he got to make it in its ideal setting: in Russia, with Russian actors.It's also filmed in colour, a rarity for Kurosawa films.The finished product is beautifully shot and told, the story of a friendship that spanned several years and encompassed many adventures. It's also the story of a clash of lifestyles and outlooks: the urbane, rational soldier vs the superstitious and unsophisticated yet incredibly in-tune with nature hunter. Yet despite their different ages, backgrounds and outlooks the two are good friends and make a great combination.On the downside, the film is unnecessarily long. Every scene is drawn out excessively, resulting in a fair amount of patience being required to get through the whole film. It ends quite emotionally, giving you some reward for your patience, but it can be a slog at times.\",\"13\":\"If you're used to the propulsive, kinetic Kurosawa films like \\\"Seven Samurai\\\" or \\\"Throne of Blood,\\\" be warned that \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is very quiet and slow in comparison. But it's a film that rewards patience.It's a very simple film in many ways. It's about the bond that forms between a group of Soviet explorers and the Japanese tracker who helps them wend their way through the wilds of Siberia. The Soviets are pretty glib about the natural world they're traipsing through, while Dersu brings a Buddhist philosophy to his interaction with nature. It's a film that has a renewed relevancy in these days of climate catastrophe.I very much enjoyed the visual poetry of this film, filled with a reverence for the natural world. A scene set during a deadly windstorm in which Dersu and his Soviet friend must make a shelter out of prairie grass if they are to survive is one of the film's most memorable and weirdly beautiful. On the other hand, I remained ever so slightly distant from the film because of Kurosawa's decision to film almost every scene in long shot. The men are always given less importance because of how far away they are from the camera and by extension us, the audience. I'm guessing this was intentional so as to show their place in the natural world, but it does have the result of making it that much harder to become involved in their story. This is a minor quibble though, and mostly this is an exceptional film.\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" won the 1975 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Ironically, the only film to ever bring Kurosawa a competitive Oscar was won by the USSR.Grade: A\",\"14\":\"This is one world-class piece of work desperately in the waiting line for a BluRay revamp, watched this Kurosawa's Soviet Union film in DVD format, the quality is discouraging, but the film speaks for itself in shedding bells and whistles and homing in on a camaraderie between a Soviet military explorer and a seasoned local hunter among the bleak Ussuri inhospitable region. Storyline-aside, it is another Kurosawa's awesome visual spectacle, a tremendous field shooting endeavor, epitomizes by the sun-moon co-existence with solemn placidness, furthermore, it is a hymn to mother nature, Dersu personifies as the harmonious co-habitant of the mighty wilderness, a sublime soul with well-versed survival skills, on the contrary to my recent watched documentary TOUCHING THE VOID (2003, 8\\/10), DERSU UZALA owns a purer and more admirable prospect, instead of conquering the insurmountable to chase a spur of glory and invincibility, it is far more intrepid and unpretentious to be a part of it with reverence and be respectful to its law and act, in addition to its indefatigable undertone against industrialized modernism (it is the brand-new rifle, a token of friendship, actually wreaks the somber demise of Dersu). Strictly speaking, there is merely two characters in the film, Dersu (Munzuk) and the Russian Captain (Solomin), a bond is tenably formed through their expedition in the wild, from lush jungle to walking-on-the-thin-ice frozen river, the life-saving bravado during a squalling night when they lost their track on a snow land or a torrent peril, Kurosawa molds a great range of topography with taut excitement where it is required. The character study of Dersu also is been executed through the observation and the interaction from Captain (viewers' proxy), who is enthralled by Dersu's simple yet ethereal nature, a rare bird may or may not be extinct now. The dual-acting from Munzuk and Solomin is the fruit of naturalistic emancipation and unassuming engagement. Also a memorable presence is Isaak Shvarts's accompanying score segues from lithe to menacing, eerie to sonorous, with Russian folklore and shanty as well.Being a Chinese, I cannot avoid mentioning the sensitive timing (after China and Japan's rapprochement in 1972 and China and Soviet Union's dispute in 1969) of the film-making, which prompted an accusation from Chinese government concerns a so-called political libel on Chinese people, mainly by vilifying Hunhutsi (which literally means red beard in Mandarin) as the villain and the nature-balance defier. But honestly, this episode is largely overstated since there is no direct confrontation at all in the film, at least for my compatriots, don't let this smokescreen blinds your eyes, DERSU UZALA is a spirited ethnological oeuvre could inspire whoever has a chance to watch it, preferably on a big screen or at least a BluRay edition.\",\"15\":\"How fantastic is it that Kurosawa was a fan of Russian literature, and picked this obscure memoir to make a film out of when the Soviet production company Mosfilm approached him during a very difficult period in his life. Somehow it seems appropriate, being so quiet and contemplative, and like a return to truth or one's original self. The story is fairly simple, relating the real-life adventures of an exploration into the rugged region around the Ussuri river basin when the group's captain (Vladimir Arsenyev, played by Yury Solomin) befriends a mountain man (Dersu Uzala, played by Maxim Munzuk).Early on we see that Dersu identifies everything around him as a person - the sun, moon, wind, water, a tiger, etc. It seems childlike, but it's actually rather profound - he sees a unity to everything, and that man is not separate from his environment. He lives as one with nature, respects its power, doesn't waste, and helps others when he can. As the captain says, \\\"He had a beautiful soul. He provided for the needs of a person he didn't know, and probably wouldn't ever see.\\\" He also recognizes subtle signs in things like tracks or weather conditions that others can't see. The scene where he ingeniously builds a makeshift shelter out of tall grasses on the taiga when it gets late and the wind starts howling is excellent. I don't know whether this character or movie helped shaped George Lucas's vision of Yoda, but there are certainly similarities.The pace of the film is on the slow side, and that combined with minimal action may turn some viewers off, but I found that it went well with Dersu's spirit and the environment they were in. \\\"Man is very small before the face of nature,\\\" the film says, as Kurosawa gives us beautiful footage of wide open spaces, ice floes, and forests. Let the simplicity wash over you and cleanse you, like Dersu undoubtedly did with Arsenyev's soul. It's not Kurosawa's very best, but this is a good one, and it got the 65-year-old director back on track to make more films at the end of his career.\",\"16\":\"Akira Kurosawa's only non-Japanese film presents the revered filmmaker journeying to Soviet Union to fully realise one of his passion projects. Set in early 1900s Siberia, the story of Dersu Uzala covers the journey of two men from different backgrounds who meet during a surveying expedition and forge a close bond while battling the elemental forces in the midst of the harsh frontier.Also co-written by Kurosawa, the film is about man, nature, friendship & clashing of different lifestyles and addresses it through the exploits of its dual characters. Kurosawa offers ample space for their relationship to breathe & blossom and films the Russian far east wilderness in awe-inspiring detail. Shot in 70mm, the photography is absolutely spellbinding to look at and effortlessly enraptures the senses.The picture however lacks the gripping quality of the director's best-known works and unfolds at too relaxed a pace which in turn makes its 144 mins runtime feel overlong. While the drama is far from tedious, the slow patches & occasional stillness do bother at times. Yury Solomin & Maxim Munzuk play the Russian explorer & titular trapper respectively with sincerity and their bonding not only feels genuine but also earned.Overall, Dersu Uzala is another diligently crafted feature from the Japanese auteur and is as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking. Its emotional grip on viewers may vary but the technical craftsmanship on display remains impressive throughout. A gorgeous addition to Kurosawa's rich & resonant body of work, this Soviet-Japanese production may pale in comparison to his greatest efforts but it is nonetheless worthy of a broader viewership.\",\"17\":\"\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is a Biography - Adventure movie in which we watch a man going to explore the snowy Siberian wilderness for the Russian army. There he meets a local hunter who helps him a lot and they both create a special bond.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a simple but simply beautiful plot that contained plenty of suspense. This made it even more interesting and the direction which was made by Akira Kurosawa was simply amazing since his point of view and his touch created this beautiful movie. The interpretations of both Maksim Munzuk who played as Dersu Uzala and Yuriy Solomin who played as Arsenev were very good and they both did an excellent job. To sum up, I have to admit that \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" was a big surprise and I highly recommend everyone to watch it.\",\"18\":\"The photography is good, occasionally terrific even, and the casting is impeccable, especially of the title character. The relationship between the two guys, who are very likable, seems genuine and not overly sentimental. It's a breath of fresh air to occasionally get away from American movies and watch something different.Now to the negative side. As is typical with many non-American or non-British movies, everything moves too slowly often. The early parts of both sections (1902 and 1907) have scenes that are simply dull. Americans have understood and learned early on that a movie cannot be told in \\\"real time\\\" or anywhere close to it. Only relevant moments\\/scenes should be in the final cut. Story-telling in a movie cannot be like that in a novel, not even close. Kurosawa is nowhere nearly the kind of pretentious, almost useless director like Bergman, but he does make some of the same mistakes. Who wants to watch a group of soldiers walk for 3 minutes without any dialogue or anything at all relevant occurring? This kind of slow-paced tool can be justified only when it serves to build up suspense or when the scene is extraordinarily beautiful (see Kubrick).Send me an e-mail, Orphy, I cannot answer your brilliant message on this site...\",\"19\":\"Kurosawa directed 33 films, and this one belongs to his last ones and is the masterpiece among them, which most seem to agree with. It is a profound revelation of nature by the affectionate portrait of a very natural man, a hunter, who becomes a guide to a troop of charting soldiers, forming an expedition to explore the far east of Siberia. The film is divided in two parts, and the first part is a marvel of beauty with some extremely exciting sequences showing Dersu Uzala's superior craft of surviving any natural ordeal. The second part is greener, there is less ice and winter and instead lush growth, mosquitos and civil life in town, while here is the crucial incident of the tiger. The sequences of the tiger are marvellously shot, and although it's a mere incident it looms into an overwhelming omen foreboding Dersu Uzala's end, which he fully understands himself but no one else. When the end comes it is not about a tiger or any natural phenomena at all but something completely different that no one could have guessed. I have seen most of Kurosawa's films, but this one struck me as something completely out of his normal style and definitely among the best of them all, especially for its beauty. \\\"Rashomon\\\" may have been his most impressing film, for its very awesome intrigue, while this one has not much of an intrigue but the more of natural lyricism - the direct association with nature in all its unfathomable magic is the essence of the intrigue here, which is entirely mystical. The film is unforgettable for its beauty and human feeling, and even the music is splendidly compiled. This is and will remain an all time classic and maybe Kurosawa's best.\",\"20\":\"Friendship blossoms between a Russian army captain and a local hunter he recruits to guide his soldiers through the wilderness in this Akira Kurosawa epic filmed on location in the Soviet Union. The film benefits from Kurosawa's eye for natural beauty when it comes to vast landscapes untouched by civilisation, however, what really drives the film is the bond that develops between the main characters - and in spite of other soldiers ridiculing the local hunter behind his back. This very real bond leads to an especially engaging final quarter in which the captain tries to give the hunter a better life by inviting him to live with him, only to discover that despite their deep friendship, they each want something different out of life (\\\"how do you live inside a box?\\\"). The first three quarters of the film are not quite as compelling as this final section, but they are still engaging enough as the two main characters survive through harsh conditions, coming to appreciate each other just a little more in the process. The movie may have benefited from less focus on the other soldiers who are rather dull and ultimately interchangeable, and yet, they serve as an acute counterpoint to their captain who is able to see past stereotypes and racial prejudice and recognise right away the skills, talent and humanity of the hunter who, in some ways, is more civilised than the soldiers who mock him.\",\"21\":\"This 1975 joint Japanese-Russian film is a celebration of simple virtues, friendship, loyalty, love, and respect for nature. Based on the journals of the Tsarist explorer and surveyor, Captain Vladimir Arseniev, it is the story of the relationship between Captain Arseniev and an Asiatic hunter of the Goldi tribe named Dersu Uzala. With a love and understanding of the forest that is extraordinary, Dersu guides the Captain through several deadly encounters. He saves the Captain's life by building a shelter out of reeds during a ferocious wind storm. Maksim's performance as Dersu, the ancient woodsman, is very \\\"Yoda-like\\\": wonderous, dignified, and very natural. The friendship between the two main characters grows over many years and several expeditions in the wild. Their relationship is beautifully developed and moves to an inevitable climax when Dersu and the Captain move back to the Captain's home in the city.There is in this film a sense of the beauty, tranquility, and timelessness of nature. It takes place at a time in the early part of the last century when people had closer ties with nature and felt a kinship with animals, plants, and the elements. Dersu endearingly refers to all elements of nature including the river, the wind, the trees, and the animals as \\\"men\\\". As the English writer, Hugh Trevor-Roper said of Shakespeare so it is true of Dersu, \\\"He sees mankind almost as part of nature, sometimes basking in a delightful, smiling Nature; sometimes caught up in a fierce, cruel, inexorable, insatiable Nature\\\".I was totally absorbed in this film and in its regard for the essential goodness of man and the beauty of the natural world. Dersu Uzala is a great film from one of the all-time masters.\",\"22\":\"Vladimir Arsenyev (played by Yury Solomin ), a Russian explorer exploring the far Eastern reaches of the country, engages Nanai hunter Dersu Uzala (played by Tuvan actor Maxim Munzuk) as a guide and soon becomes dependant on the native's expertise in tracking and in surviving on the inhospitable taiga. The men's developing friendship is poignant but not sentimentalised, and the two actors, as well as the secondary cast, are excellent in a very low-key, deliberate story. The cinematography is outstanding, especially the expansive images of the cold, barren winter plains and of the vast forests of eastern Siberia. The Japanese-Soviet co-production was directed by Akira Kurosawa and the weather imagery so prevalent in his films is used to great effect - I haven't felt this chilled while watching a film since 'Scott of the Antarctic' (1948).\",\"23\":\"The Sikhote-Alin region of Siberia \\u0096 cold, bleak and unforgiving \\u0096 stretches towards the horizon, an endless haze of snowy rocks and stunted forests. There is seemingly little happiness to be found in the icy, windswept plains of the wilderness, where overexposure has claimed the lives of hundreds of under-prepared explorers, and where the nearest human being might not wander within one hundred miles of your present location. Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev made several journeys into the area in the early years of the twentieth century, charged with performing a topographical survey of the vast region's many mountains, valleys, rivers and lakes. Arsenyev released countless memoirs detailing his explorations, but his most well-known work is \\\"Dersu Uzala (Dersu the Trapper),\\\" published in 1923, which details his three expeditions into the Ussurian taiga of Northern Asia, particularly his interactions with a Nanai\\/Goldi native guide named Dersu Uzala, who has acquired incredible knowledge, instincts and observation skills through his lifetime of living as a lone nomad in the harsh frontier wilderness.If I ever had any doubts that Akira Kurosawa was my kind of film director, then I may now consider them groundless. After two solid but flawed efforts in 'Stray Dog (1949)' and 'Rashomon (1950),' I have finally uncovered my first genuine masterpiece from the famed Japanese director, an awesome 70mm epic that emphasises the harshness of the Siberian wilderness, the detrimental consequences of human progress, and the ever-important bond of male friendship. 'Dersu Uzala (1975)' uncovers indescribable beauty in the sheer malevolence of the isolated forest region, where the sunlight, glinting off the fractured layers of snow and ice, offers only mild relief from the bitter winter cold, and where men cluster eagerly around a roaring campfire to absorb the glowing heat from its flames. In the maddening seclusion of the forest, it is only through teamwork and friendship that travellers can hope to survive the elements, and, in lonely hunter Dersu Uzala, Arsenyev discovers a genuine friend, whose intelligence, awareness and compassion can only be admired with the utmost reverence.Akira Kurosawa, working with cinematographers Fyodor Dobronravov, Yuri Gantman and Asakazu Nakai, has committed to celluloid some of the most strikingly-gorgeous images since David Lean's 'Lawrence of Arabia (1962).' The wilderness of Siberia is, at first glance, exceedingly mundane and unremarkable, but, out of the sheer isolation and purity of the landscape, Kurosawa uncovers a noble beauty about the trees, rocks, waters and, indeed, the people who survive there. The film's most breathtaking shot shows Arsenyev and Dersu perched before a pristine sunset, the pair perfectly-framed between the blazing red Sun and the ascending Moon. Out of a bitter windstorm on the frozen expanses of a lake, Kurosawa crafts an intense episode of nail-biting suspense, as the two frantically attempt to gather grass for the purposes of constructing a crude but vital sleeping shelter, their only opportunity to avoid freezing to death in the relentless cold of the Siberian night. Recognising the inherent beauty in the landscape he was photographing, Kurosawa often makes excellent use of long takes, allowing the viewer to simply sit back and absorb the majesty of the wilderness with which he has been surrounded.Another important theme in 'Dersu Uzala' is the cultural and environmental toll of progress. It was only during the early years of the 1900s that the Sikhote-Alin region of Siberia began to abandon its old-time traditions and lifestyles in order to catch up with the more advanced civilisations that surrounded it. Dersu, who has lived alone in the forest for much of his life, proves a final victim of society's progress, a tragic symbol of a culture that has been irretrievably lost in the past. With his dwindling eyesight, and an escalating superstitious paranoia of the forest caused by his senseless murder of a tiger, Dersu finds that he can no longer provide for himself, and so accompanies Arsenyev back to his home in the city. His spirit crushed and broken, Dersu spends his days staring soullessly into the burning fireplace, consumed by memories of his lifetime in the free and peaceful isolation of the forest. He eventually resolves to return to the wilderness, but is shortly murdered for his expensive rifle; the lone hunter has now been completely destroyed by the unstoppable march of progress, which brings along both its benefits and its unavoidable evils.\",\"24\":\"this film is so good, it surely deserves 500% points. it was the first Russian-Japanese movie that made me cry. it was better than good. it showed me a lot of things I already knew but in a different way and it made me think about it in another way. it also proved me a lot of things I couldn't tell anyone about. it is probably the best Kurosawa ever made, way better than Shichinin no Samarai, a genre I loved too, but not anymore. well, maybe still, but Dersu Uzala is so much more. it's so BEEPing good, it has so much emotional levels many of the films on the IMDb top 250 don't have. if you read this, you'll know: I can't find words to describe this movie and that doesn't happen a lot. it's a beautiful picture.\",\"25\":\"Sometimes, it is possible to see how a movie director's changing life has impacted on the way in which he or she approaches making a motion picture. Don't worry, I'm not some crazy auteurist; I'm not talking about themes or symbolism, just the changing relationship between the camera and the material. In 1970 Akira Kurosawa suffered the disastrous commercial and critical failure of Dodesukaden, a picture he had poured a lot of his own funds into producing. Soon after this lifelong humanist made what we can assume was an earnest but thankfully unsuccessful suicide attempt. Dersu Uzala was his the picture he made next.Dersu Uzala is often categorised as an anomaly in the Kurosawa filmography anyway, as it was his only feature made outside his native Japan. This adaptation of a Russian explorer's memoir is a potentially serious departure for a director who previously wrote all his own scripts and always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of Japanese society. Still, the wilderness setting and interaction between humanity and landscape in the story ultimately makes this a tale that could be of any time or place. The largely Russian film crew seems particularly in tune with the Japanese director's sensibilities. The musical scoring by Isaak Shvarts has that beautiful haunting quality of Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, which Kurosawa would no doubt have appreciated. His long-term director of photography Asakazu Nakai works with a pair of Russian cinematographers to great some wonderful images that have the warm softness of impressionist painting.This last point is particularly important for the late-period Kurosawa. He had long been an accomplished amateur painter, but never has this been more apparent in his film work than in Dersu Uzala. We now see in him a desire to create smooth tonal patterns for the screen, creating compositions that are primarily for aesthetic value, even something as mundane as the shot of sleeping soldiers before they meet Dersu, in which everything is arranged in harmonious diagonals. Howard Hawks once derided the widescreen format as being a bad move because it was a shape rarely chosen by painters, but Kurosawa manages perfectly with it. Painterly his approach may be but it is still cinematic. His frequent use of movement in depth shows his understanding of the frame as a three-dimensional space as oppose to simply a short, wide box. Often a little movement and sound adds to the overall impression, the ripple of water, the crackle of fire and the noises of wind and creatures. With complete control over every element of a shot, Kurosawa is constantly seeking to evoke the might of the forest, its beauty and its mystery.This may be conjecture, but it may be that Kurosawa, shaken by his recent experiences and advancing age, is here taking a step back, unable to connect with fully his subject and humanity in general. After all, painting is generally a solitary pursuit. There are no close-ups in Dersu Uzala, and an unusually low proportion of mid-shots. We are rarely encouraged to focus on facial expressions, and almost always take the place of detached observers, lurking in the bushes. Also contrary to much of Kurosawa's earlier pictures, in which the acting was often flamboyant and hammy, the players here are subdued and realistic \\u2013 something which incidentally lead players Yuri Solomin and Maxim Munzuk respond especially well to, with Munzuk's performance being incredibly moving at times in its subtle expression. And yet Kurosawa barely allows us to feel as if we know these characters. The physical sense of distance makes us feel like voyeurs on their lives, and while the picture is filled with breathtaking beauty the director's tendency to envelop us in the human warmth of a story has vanished.However as an uplifting postscript, Dersu Uzala was a considerable success, especially at the Russian box office, also gaining recognition elsewhere including an Oscar for Best foreign picture. This veteran director, back from the brink of despair, would soon make some fruitful collaborations with Hollywood producers, and his career would end in a blaze of glory.\",\"26\":\"Akira Kurosawa was a masterful director and powerful storyteller, Dersu has always been my favourite of his films. It was also the first I saw - on Christmas Day afternoon 1978 on UK BBC2 - would that they were as adventurous nowadays! Since then of course I've seen all of his films from Stray Dog on, Rashomon and Ran being especial favourites, but I keep on coming back to watch this one, ostensibly the simplest tale Kurosawa ever filmed.The understanding and bonding that develops between the two men Arseniev and Dersu is wonderful to see, and over two hours holds your attention with expertly observed minutiae of character and scenic interplay. The last ten minutes cover a lot of ground (no pun intended) but it's all so logical and sad that I always need to see the end credits to recover.So many marvellous scenes: the tiger in the forest in the morning; the phlegmatic reclusive old Chinaman; the raft; wispy blue shaded smoke from night-fires; the conclusion of course; the view of those two great men, the Moon and the Sun in the same shot. Not everyone would like Dersu, their most likely comments being \\\"boring\\\" - but how wrong they are they'll never know!A film not fit to lick Dersu Uzala's metaphorical boots (or even Plan 9 from Outer Space's for that matter), Blazing Saddles was filmed the same year in America and a generation on still gets more praise than this poetic masterpiece!\",\"27\":\"\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" was in 1975 a come back film of Kurosawa, financed with Russian capital. It is one of the few films situated in Siberia. The only other one I know of being \\\"The letter that was never sent\\\" (1960, Mikhail Kalatozov).Although taking place in Siberia the film has definite characteristics of the Western genre. In stead of \\\"Go west young man\\\" in this case it rather is \\\"Go east young man\\\"The young man is captain Arsenyev (Yuri Solomin) of the Russian army being on an expedition. He encounters the nomadic Dersu Uzala (Maksim Munzuk) from the Nanai people. This \\\"Western\\\" being of the modern nature, there grows a friendship between the newcomer and the traditional inhabitant based on mutual respect.For Arsenyev the wilderness is dangerous and in the city (in this film Chabarovsk) he is at home. For Dersu Uzala it turns out to be the other way around. When he is forced by old age to live in the house of his friend Arsenyev he is, despite the enjoyed hospitality, deeply unhappy. At last he decides to return to the forest, which by now is also dangerous for him.\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" has beautiful landscape imagery. Like \\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\\" (1962, David Lean) this can only be fully enjoyed on the big screen. Unfortunately I have never been able to see \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" in a movie theatre.\",\"28\":\"Dersu Uzala is a delightful film about a native man from Siberia who helps out a Russian Captain and his soldiers. The film is a powerful piece that looks at the difference between those who live on the land, and those who have grown up in more \\\"civilized\\\" society that are merely exploring the wilderness. It's hard not to love the character of Dersu Uzala, because he is so smart and loaded with wisdom from a lifetime of living in these conditions. I thought Maksim Munzuk was wonderful at portraying this charming fellow, and showing his never-ending supply of energy. Yuriy Solomin was also great as the Russian officer who forms a bond with Dersu, and I loved watching the progression of their relationship.There were certainly moments of this film where it felt like the story was dragging a little, but most of the time I was fully invested because I cared about these characters. The final act was hard to watch because I could see what was coming, and I knew it wasn't good news. I had real tears by the end of the movie, and that is always a sign that a movie has impacted me on a more profound emotional level. I've seen other films that emulate this same story, and in general it's not typically the type of drama that connects with me in that way, but I think the titular character had garnered so much goodwill that I didn't care if it felt like something I've seen before. Dersu Uzala is a long film that is even broken down into 2 separate acts, but I think it was well worth the time investment.\",\"29\":\"( NOT FOR 2020 Netflix kids )\\nReserved only for Meaningful people in the worldOUTSTANDING MASTERPIECE\\nThe pinnacle of quality film making.Oh My God even my words not enough to describe his work\\nBeautiful in so many ways.Admirable and heart-warming, beautiful fellowship.A masterpiece of cinema directed by a guy at an age when he should have been busy going senile but instead delivers his best film ever. Truly wonderful and genuinely inspired filmmaking.\",\"30\":\"Besides the great technical features (image, sound track music) and the wonderful performance of Maksim Munzuk as Dersu Uzala, the story is overpowering and passionate. In 1902 A team of Russian army explorers in Siberia going through the wild forests commanded by Captain Arsenev meets a local Asian Nanai hunter who joins the team that take him as a guide. The several episodes that follow show that the explorers accept heartily Dersu and a personal deep friendship develops itself between Dersu and Captain Arsenev despite their deep social and cultural different levels.All this is shown through several dramatic scenes very well filmed and performed. A moving movie indeed.\",\"31\":\"The bulk of this film concerns two expeditions made by a group of Soviet soldiers to map out regions of the Russian Far East in the early twentieth century. In the first expedition in 1902 the soldiers meet Dersu Uzala, an older hunter wise to ways of living on his own in a harsh environment; Uzala accompanies them and serves as a valuable guide. In the second expedition in 1907 the soldiers happily meet Uzala again by chance. I came to appreciate this movie more when I realized that it is based on the memoirs of one Vladimir Arsenyev who made three major expeditions and did indeed encounter a hunter called Dersu.The expeditions are filled will dangers and drama. A most memorable scene has Dersu and Arsenyev cutting grasses to make a shelter for themselves in order to survive a bitter cold night where they would have died if exposed. Kurosawa is a master of filming such scenes.However, the movie is much more than an adventure story. At its heart is the somewhat improbable friendship that develops between Uzala and Arsenyev. When not out on explorations Arsenyev lives comfortably in Vladivostok with a wife and young son whereas Uzala makes it on his own in the back-country. Arsenyev does not have the skills to live like Uzala, nor, as we come to see, does Uzala have the temperament to live like Arsenyev.A person who feels he cannot live without the internet probably has lost a lot of the basic skills and appreciation of nature that Uzala has. The ultimate irony is that the explorations of Arsenyev to document and map the areas pave the way for the development of interdependent social institutions that lead to the extinction of people like Uzala. Kurosawa tends to exaggerate for effect, which I suppose we all do, but I had a hard time believing that Uzala could shoot an early twentieth-century rifle and hit a swinging string at fifty yards. Initially I felt that some of the scenes went on much longer than their welcome. Did I need to watch an old Chinese man walk away into the snow for a minute and a half? But then I began to appreciate the pacing--it gives you some time to absorb and think about what is going on. This film is in stark contrast to most current movies that assault your senses and are tuned for short attention spans.Maksim Munzuk is near perfect as Uzala. Not much is demanded from the Russian actors as soldiers but, even at that, their performances seemed a flat to me.\",\"32\":\"Kurosawa made this Japanese-Russian co-production after a three year hiatus, reportedly after a suicide attempt caused by the failure of his previous film. This film won the Foreign Film Oscar, so it was sort of a comeback film for Kurosawa. Based on a real story, the movie is set in the Russian far east in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Basically, is about a Russian captain and explorer befriending a native called Dersu Uzala (of the ethnic group which today is referred as the nanai), after he saves his live during a snow storm. Most of the movie then deals with their friendship as they explore and hunt together in the wilds of eastern Siberia. When Dersu's vision no longer makes him able to hunt, the Russian brings him to the city to live with his family. But for a man who has always lived in the woods, urban civilization seems very strange, so he pleads to the captain to return to his native place. Unfortunately, time has not passed in vain, and in the woods he will find an early demise. It's a great adventure film, though one wonders if the relations between the Russians and the Siberian natives were always as friendly as this movie shows. One detail: though some of the movie was shot on location, other parts are shot in a studio, pretending to be a forest, and sadly, that shows. Still, I think this is one of Kurosawa's good films (though not among his best).\",\"33\":\"Dersu Uzala takes the best bits from, say, Andrei Tarvosky - the languishing and poetical visuals but omits his often gregarious and incomprehensible plots, to leave a fine mixture of storytelling, character building and epic scale. The cinematography is often breathtaking.In two parts, the two and three quarter hour film, introduces us to an almost Siberian \\\"Indian\\\", the sort we might have seen in westerns from the '50s. Dersu Uzala is a simple trapper in his 70's, living from hand to mouth in the wastelands of Siberia. Lush in summer, bleak and raw (and arctic) in winter he relies totally on his instinct and experience. He has also escaped from a previous 'life'. In the 19th century, a group of Russian army surveyors are mapping the area and become out of their depth in the relative wilderness. They stumble upon Dersu and they soon form an unbreakable bond and through a series of survival adventures and near death skirmishes with the inclement weather and nature itself the film moves with dignity and statesmanship. What will happen to the ageing Dersu? Can this wild man ever be tamed? These are all the questions that this Oscar winning fable addresses - and more. Kurosawa's own life mirrored Dersu's alienation and for those of more used to the director's ruggedly brilliant black & white masterpieces made thirty odd years prior, will find this refreshing - and moving. This is one film that can be enjoyed by all. Take it in one, or two sittings and let the warmth, frailty - and harshness - of one man and his surroundings wash over you.\",\"34\":\"Once in a while, very rarely, I have the pleasure of watching a movie that reminds me of how much good humans are capable of. Told in a simple, linear way, director Akira Kurosawa and his co-collaborator Yuri Nagibin adapt Vladimir Arsenyev's novel Dersu Uzala, about a Russian army captain that befriends a hunter in the Siberian regions. In charge of a military expedition to map out the terrain, Captain Arseniev invites Dersu, an experienced and tough-as-nails old hunter, to guide him and his men across forests and polar deserts back into safety in civilization.Maksim Munzuk, at the age of 65, plays Dersu. At an age when great actors start becoming parodies of themselves \\u2013 who can stand Al Pacino or Robert DeNiro nowadays? \\u2013 this unknown Russian actor played the greatest role of his life and arguably left us one of the greatest performances in film history. He is short but robust, silent but expressive in his manners, and always honest and outspoken in his words. A simple man, he seeks no glory or profit; he helps Arseniev and his men out of genuine kindness.Yuri Solomon plays Arseniev, a humble officer who appreciates the help Dersu can offer him. Unprejudiced and curious, he observes Dersu with great interest and eventually forms a friendship with him that lasts for as long as they live. This is the movie at its core: friendship and humanity amidst a world that can easily kill us, as the Siberian regions proves several times throughout the movie. Using wide shots throughout the movie, Kurosawa shows how insignificant men are in comparison with the nature surrounding them, how beautiful the world is and how blessed we are to live in it.Every element of Dersu Uzala contributed to making this one of the best movies I've ever seen: the acting by the main actors; the cinematography by Asakazu Nakai; Isaac Shvarts' score. Watching Dersu Uzala is almost contemplating perfection.\",\"35\":\"For a filmmaker so often credited for his bold action scenes and epic storytelling, it is always somewhat disarming to see a picture like Dersu Uzala (1975), a film that sees Akira Kurosawa dispose of his trademark samurais and sweeping battle sequences and concentrate on a more humanitarian story. The film focuses on the strong friendship that grows between a Russian soldier and a mysterious Goldi hunter in the forests of east Siberia. The Russian, Captain Vladimir Arseniev, enlists the strange and mysterious Dersu as a guide through the stark, dangerous and uncharted deserts and forests. As the two men trek even further into the unknown, an unspoken bond and deep mutual respect grows between them. When Vladimir finds out that Dersu has developed a serious problem with his eyesight, he invites him to stay with his family in the city.The film makes points on the clash between nature and industry, beginning with the destruction of a forest, as well as the more obvious ideas of loyalty and friendship. Both Yuri Solomin and Maksim Munzuk are great in their respective lead roles, displaying a warm and believable chemistry, even if the overwhelming beauty of Kurosawa's frame at times overshadows them. Dersu Uzala is a slow moving film that rewards, with the filmmaker clearly understanding the value of character and the importance of subtle detail. The second act detracts from the grace of the story by trying to say too much about the loss of nature within the growth of industry, but this is a minor flaw that does not ruin the overall effect. This is exemplary film-making worthy of classic status, interesting and enjoyable, and a good place to start for anyone interested in the work of Kurosawa.\",\"36\":\"One of the most beautiful  films I have ever seen.\\nSimple, gentle gold hunter-guide Munzuk teaches Russian explorer Solomine the rules of survival in Siberia; they develop mutual respect and friendship. The acting by Maksim Munzuk is wonderful and this is one of Kurosawasgreatest films.You never forget this amazing film.5\\/5\",\"37\":\"This film was made when a member of the Russian embassy contacted Akira Kurosawa, asking him to make a Russian film for Russians. The result? A beautiful film, both inside and out. What I mean is that it stands out as an art piece, the mise-en- sc\\u00e8ne, the cinematography. But also as a beautiful portrait of the great friendship shared by two men with two distinct ways of living, two seemingly contradicting mindsets, and two disparate socioeconomic strata. So much if the film is dependent on acting performances and emotion rather than dialogue. As always, Kurosawa relied heavily on the symbolic nature of natural phenomena (rain, snow, a rainbow) to aid in his storytelling. (Pun intended.) Kurosawa's first film not in Japanese, as well as his only work in 70mm. Production took three years, being shot entirely outdoors in nature on location in Russia, of course making for some magnificent cinematography. As a side note, the fascinating fact that this achievement by Japanese director Akira Kurosawa won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Russia finally motivated me to figure out what, exactly, the Academy considers a \\\"Foreign Language Film\\\". This is something I have wondered about for sometime but was unable to discern, until now. What I had to do was the obvious. Go to the source. (http:\\/\\/www.anica.it\\/allegati\\/OSCAR\\/90_FLFA_RU LE_THIRTEEN.pdf) I also found an article that elucidates the small details for interested readers. (https:\\/\\/www.thoughtco.com\\/qualifying-best- foreign-language-film-oscar-2421430)\",\"38\":\"Fresh from the disappointed Dodeskaden and a tragic suicide attempt, Kurosawa went to Russia for a fresh start, where the Soviet authorities invited him to shoot a film of his choosing. Kurosawa opted for Vladimir Arseniev's titular travel log.Dersu Uzala follows Soviet cartographer Arseniev and his crew through the Ussuri region, where they meet the title character, a local trapper living in harmony with nature. What follows is a deliberate, contemplative \\\"road movie\\\" of sorts, the record of an unusual but touching friendship.This was nothing short of a resurrection project for Kurosawa: a clean break with everything he had ever done, and with almost anyone he had ever worked with. While it is daunting to watch it knowing that the director managed collaborators in a foreign language in hellish conditions and still shaken from a life crisis, discarding all that in no way diminishes the film's merits. It is an immaculate tone-poem, haunted by the ghost of Kurosawa's erstwhile friend Andrei Tarkovsky. It is a hymn to nature, turning the landscape into a character in ways none of Kurosawa's earlier films had done. Given the language-barrier, the performances deserve special mention, especially from the central duo: Maxim Munzuck creates a character for the ages with his proto-Yoda Dersu, but Yuri Solomin anchors the proceedings as the subdued, likable Arsenyev. The photography is more than up to the usual Kurosawa standards, and all the tech credits follow suit. The film won that year's Academy Award for best foreign film and begin the master filmmaker's last trio of epic masterpieces. It might stand out as somewhat of a black sheep in his oeuvre, a moment of contemplation in between the bursts of fury and energy of his other films, yet it managed to transcend its status as a career footnote to become one of his greatest achievements.Do not allow yourself to overlook this beauty.\",\"39\":\"Kurosawa's co-Russian production film 'Dersu Uzala', a tale about a bonding friendship between a Goldi Siberian hunter and a Russian surveyor, is filled with classic touches of cinematic beauty, great character development, and sometimes edge of the seat survival.This has to be one of the most beautiful looking films put to screen that I have ever seen.  The landscape is filled with the change of the seasons of great autumn colours, lakes that mirror great reflections, smoke over fire in a blue hue, to winter desolate landscapes and sheering sun that sets on the fateful band of men who dare to pass through the dangerous terrain.Throw in a great bond of characters and a lesson about a time when humanity was more in touch with nature instead of trying to dominate it, a classic Kurosawa ending, and you have cinematic gold.  A film not to be missed on the big screen.Rating 9 out of 10\",\"40\":\"Akira Kurosawa's \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" (1975) is an oddity in the director's oeuvre, but nonetheless, or precisely because of it, beloved by many. It has a historical setting, though it has no samurais and very little action. It focuses on the lyric moments of humanity which have always been integral to the beauty of Kurosawa's cinema. The film is based on Vladimir Arsenev's novel about his expeditions to Ussuria in the early 20th century during which he became acquainted with an aging hunter living in the woods, gathering all he needs from the environment. The simple charm of the story probably fascinated Kurosawa and offered a perfect basis for that time in his career. Before making \\\"Derzu Uzala\\\", Kurosawa had suffered both a professional and a personal tragedy as his first film in color \\\"Dodes'ka-den\\\" (1970) became a huge financial flop, and subsequently Kurosawa tried to commit suicide. Thus, in the early 1970's Kurosawa had truly lost his faith in cinema, the modern world, and life itself (for a moment at least). For this level of desolation, Arsenev's story offered a perfect means of meditation since its setting was far from capitalism and modern life as well as contemporary cinema. After all, \\\"Derzu Uzala\\\" is, at its heart, a story about total unselfishness, utter humility, and the beauty of life in touch with nature. What is more, Kurosawa uses a veritably lingering narrative which is combined with ascetic aesthetics. Overall, the style is very stripped. The gorgeous shots of the Russian landscape may be sublime, but it is really the landscape that is sublime. The form that shows it is naturalistic. \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is far from the surrealistic poetry combined with Gorky's realism that characterized Kurosawa's previous film, \\\"Dodes'ka-den\\\". It is much simpler. It gave Kurosawa a moment to contemplate the values and ideals of life that were dearest to him.In all its simplicity, \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" tells us about the friendship between two different men: a Russian soldier, Arsenev, and a self-reliant hunter, Dersu. It studies the conflict of nature and civilization which forces a life of nature to diminish. The heart-rending tale is heavy with nostalgic yearning for the past and a melancholic sense of emptiness for the future. All this might sound sentimental, but somehow Kurosawa manages to create a character out of Dersu that is not idealized in a sentimental fashion. Yet, it is very difficult to point out the elements in the film which cause this effect; that is, the believable disposition of Dersu's character. On paper, it sounds naive and sentimental, but on screen -- in Kurosawa's images -- it gathers a new dimension. Arguably \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is the simplest story Kurosawa ever told, but maybe even more importantly it is also the story which he told in the simplest fashion.\",\"41\":\"When Akira Kurosawa's film, 'Do-Des-Ka-Den'(1970)was deemed both a critical,as well as box office failure,Kurosawa found it difficult to obtain financial backing for film projects. In 1974,after a failed suicide attempt,he decided to seek money from outside Japan for a film. Good fortune came in the form of a trip to the former U.S.S.R.,where he was offered to direct a film adaptation of the classic Russian novel, Dersu Okhotnik,by Vladimir Arsenyev,a tale of a friend ship between a Captain in the Russian Army & a elderly man,Dersu Uzala living in the forest. Kurosawa jumped at the chance,and to make a long story short, in 1975,'Dersu Uzala' was released in the U.S.S.R. to acclaim,and eventually released world wide. It's easy to see what would make this beautifully shot,edited & directed tale of a simple man of the Earth, and the friendship he shared with a (so called)learned man,who would learn much more as a result of that friendship. Akira Kurosawa (The Seven Samurai,Ran)directs from a screenplay written by Kurosawa & Yuri Nagibin,from the novel Dersu Okhotnik,by Vladimir Arsenyev. The film's breath taking cinematography is rendered by no less than three directors of photography:Fydor Dobronvov,Yuri Gantman & Asakazu Nakai. The film's editing is supervised by Lyudmila Feiginova. The lush music score is by Issak Shvarts. The cast is headed by Maxim Manzuk,as Dersu Uzala & Yuri Soloman as Captain Vladimir Arseniev,with Svetlana Danilchenko,as Mrs.Arseniev,and Dimitri Korshikov as their young son, Wowa. With Suimenkul Chokmorov,Aleksander Pyatkov,Nikolai Valkov,and others.

The second film adaptation (the first was in 1961) of the novel of the same name by the Russian writer and outstanding researcher of the Far East Vladimir Klavdievich Arseniev. The director was the famous Akira Kurosawa, and the film was filmed by the filmmakers of the USSR and Japan. The third picture of Akira, which I really wanted to see. And here's my brief opinion - Travel across the Ussuri region. At first I wanted to highlight one drawback in the picture, but after thinking it over, I changed my mind, and therefore I will tell you about it in a separate paragraph, but for now I will consider the advantages of this historical drama, which received an Oscar (then still valid).\\nSo, here they are:\\n1. Scenario - apart from one moment (or rather a minus), the story told makes a favorable impression, because the book's primary source of the famous Russian traveler was taken as a basis. Of course, for the sake of spectacle and drama, some moments were altered and changed in places, but for me it didn't matter, because I hadn't read the book, and I am not going to do it in the near future. The film tells the story of a strong friendship between the Russian officer Vladimir Arsenyev and the Nanai hunter Dersu Uzaly, and about their travels across the Ussuri region, with its beauty and danger. Many dramatic moments, but in the final it even surprised me a little and made me think about some things. Moreover, the heroes of the picture are very similar to their historical prototypes. If you love pictures about travels, especially across Russia, stories of indestructible friendship and good dramas, well, if you are a fan of Akira Kurosawa, then you definitely come here.\\n2. Nature - originally, the role of the Ussuri region was supposed to be played by the Japanese island of Hokkaido, but when Akira came to the USSR and saw all the beauty of the Ussuri region, he decided to shoot right here, on our land - and he was right. Almost the entire picture presents the viewer with the enchanting beauty of this region, from which it is almost impossible to take your eyes off. Maybe it sounds very pathetic, but I fell in love with the Ussuri region thanks to this picture, and if I have the opportunity, then I must certainly visit this place and see all the beauty with my own eyes. The operators clearly knew how to shoot and what angles to choose. My regards.\\n3. Entourage - early twentieth century. The Far East, an extremely turbulent situation, where the attention of all the great powers is riveted. The Far Eastern borders of the Russian Empire have been little studied, which is why numerous gangs of hunghuzs use this (because of this, a scandal between the USSR and the PRC happened to the picture, well, you know this story without me, and if not, go yandeksit!), So Arsenyev travels and performs the task with the help of the Cossacks and the hunter Dersu Uzaly. The costumes, sets, atmosphere, songs - everything is perfectly done and immerses the viewer in that era.\\nNow about the minus - this is protraction. Akira had already sinned with this in the film \\\"Seven Samurai\\\", and then he decided to do the same. The first half is especially prolonged, when the heroes are silent for a long time or do not say a word at all. Why did it do that? I almost fell asleep, but Thank God that the second half is more integral and dynamic, without long pauses (well, perhaps at the end, but I forgive that), and the music is clearly not a fountain, it would be possible to work in this direction.\\nA little about the main characters:\\n1. Vladimir Arsenyev and performed by Yuri Methodievich Solomin - a Russian officer and traveler who once met Dersu Uzala - an experienced taiga hunter, which became the beginning of a strong friendship for many years. It should be said that the heroes complemented each other perfectly. Yuri Methodievich superbly played a stately and noble officer who is not at all afraid to ask Dersu for advice, for whom the taiga is his home. Bravo Yuri Methodievich! Bravo!\\n2. Dersu Uzala performed by Maksim Munzuk - an old Nanai hunter who nailed to the detachment of Vladimir Arseniev. With his experience and knowledge, he saves both him and the members of the detachment more than once. A good-natured, honest old man, with a mysterious soul and pure thoughts, living in harmony with nature. Maxim perfectly embodied the image of this legendary man on the big screen. Bravo!\\nThe picture is based on the duet of Solomin and Munzuk and the magnificent nature of the Ussuri region. Thank you Akira for creating this picture!\\nAs a result, we have a good historical drama by Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent (albeit prolonged) script, magnificent views of nature, excellent surroundings and simply amazing acting work.\\nMy rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!\",\"45\":\"A Russian explorer unexpectedly initiates a friendship and a strong connection with a Nanai hunter, while (re) discovering the immensity of the Siberian area. For many, Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece. Despite the slow and serene pace, the film involves the viewer in a whirlwind of emotions and moments of great tension, thanks to a beautiful narrative, with absolutely fabulous dialogues. A great example of the difference between two worlds (urban and rural), in a time of transition, and how each individual faces his passage through Earth. The photography, although beautiful, is not overly worked on, and that's okay (what matters here is the story, and oh my, how amazing it is). A russian film made by a japanese to be apreciated by the whole world.\",\"46\":\"It is extraordinarily beautiful film. Maksim Munzik stars as Dersu, a lonely hunter with lots of 'nature's street smarts'. He befriends with the Russian army captain who leads the team of explorers in Siberia. 'Dersu Uzala' is a tale about survival and man's ancient quest to conquer nature. It's also a tale about finding your own soul. While Dersu leads army captain and his men through rough terrains (doing it without any interest getting personal gains) he tells them about forest, and amazes them with his positive and seemingly naive (very wise, actually) outlook on life. Respect towards man and animals, living or nonliving - Dersu calls everything men or people (ljudi).Very beautiful film, but not only because of magnificent cinematography or Akira Kurosawa's masterful direction, but more because of the beautiful soul of Dersu.\",\"47\":\"Dersu Uzala is not just the quintessence of pristine cinema or a landmark in art cinema, but is also a living proof that brilliance can be achieved with absolute simplicity. Storytelling is undoubtedly one of the most potent tools known to man: from the Illiad and Odyssey of Homer to the tales of Jataka, to the 1001 nights of Arabia, to the tales of Panchatantra, to the plays of Shakespeare, man has always found ways to amuse himself by spinning the yarn of his imagination. These tales, though picturesque, fantastic and resplendent, mostly overlooked the potency of austerity vis-\\u00e0-vis grandeur as an element of revelation powerful enough to transcend the effects of all other affects know to man. Only a handful of storytellers like Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit Ray have shown the grit and perspicacity to use simplicity as the weapon to incite and hence portray the deepest of the human emotions on the celluloid. Kurosawa demonstrated the might of simplicity as an element that can pack a punch for the first time in Ikiru and followed it up with an unending list of pristine cinematic masterpieces including Seven Samurai. But, even Kurosawa's greatest critic would not find it hard to concede that cinema does not get any purer than Dersu Uzala. Dersu Uzala is a poignant tale of human bonding of trust, friendship and adoration between two contrasting individuals: a nomadic hunter and an army explorer. Captain Arseniev and his troops are on a topographic expedition and while camping during a night, they come across Dersu, who happens to be an aboriginal (Goldi) tribesman. Being fully aware of the handicap of being in a remote and tricky territory and of the indispensability of having an indigene in the ranks, Arseniev asks Dersu to be their guide. Dersu being humbled by Arseniev's courtesy obliges his offer almost immediately. We soon witness a great sense of camaraderie developing between the two of them as Dersu rises in status from being a comrade to a stalwart and a friend in the eyes of the captain. The long years of experience had equipped Dersu with a great sense of intuition and psychic-like abilities to anticipate change and danger. Dersu uses his skills to good effect as he maneuvers captain and his troops through the harsh Siberian terrain, sheltering and guarding them from the cruelties and wilderness of the Tundra. Behind the fa\\u00e7ade of a rugged hunter, we see a man of profound intellect and deep compassion in Dersu which is most conspicuous in his respect for the old Chinese and his selflessness in rescuing Captain Arseniev and one of his men. After the expedition is over, Arseniev embraces Dersu and bids him farewell as Dersu returns to the wilderness. Few years later, when Arseniev returns to Siberia on another expedition, he once again encounters Dersu, who again proves to be handy, only this time round he appears to be aging really fast as time, which can be a great healer as well as a great leveler, had begun to take a toll on the Goldi. His eyesight deteriorates under the superstitious effect of a self-imposed curse after having killed a Siberian tiger, which the Goldis worship, in an act of self-defence. Arseniev, in his pitied adoration for Dersu, takes him to the city to live with his family. Arseniev's son gets greatly attached to Dersu and his story-telling abilities, but Dersu finds it difficult to adapt to the relatively restricted and significantly tamed urban life and soon realizes that his life has been reduced to that of a captive. He implores the captain to let him return to the wilderness of the woods. With great reluctance, Arseniev grants him the permission to leave, but not before presenting his savior with a brand new rifle as a parting gift and a souvenir. Few months later, Arseniev receives a letter informing him that a dead body of a Goldi has been found with no identification on it barring Arseniev's visiting card. As Arseniev pays a visit to the place of burial, he identifies the dead Goldi to be none other than Dersu Uzala. The investigating officer speculates the Goldi's brand new rifle might have lured someone into killing him.Dersu Uzala is not just a movie, but is an experience of a lifetime. Dersu Uzala is the only movie that Akira Kurosawa shot in a language other than Japanese and he proved it once and for all that cinema at its most pristine, knows no bounds or barriers. Kurosawa uses his auteurist mastery to bring the memoirs of Russian explorer, Vladimir Arsenyev to life as he inexplicably metamorphoses cinema to new levels of poignancy and pristineness. The cinematography is breathtakingly picturesque and it evokes a sense of melancholy that makes the majestic Siberian wilderness appear hypnotic and at times, surreal. The panoramic shot of Dersu and Arseniev looking at the horizon caparisoned with the juxtaposition of the setting sun and the rising moon is also indicative of their respective lives: Dersu is long past his prime and there is no hope for revival, but Arsieniev's is still in his prime and has a promising career ahead. Dersu Uzala is strongly suggestive of the sole consistency in human life: change. It also demonstrates the might of nature as an unforgiving force, strong enough to humble even the most savage of the creatures. Dersu Uzala can also be termed as an allegorical account of the environmental imbalance that unrestrained human intervention is causing. Dersu Uzala, besides being one of Kurosawa's greatest masterpieces is one of those rare cinematic gems which can be relished again and again, each time with a completely different perspective. It's a must watch for everyone who loves and understands cinema. 10\\/10For more on cinema visit: http:\\/\\/www.apotpourriofvestiges.com\\/\",\"48\":\"This is my first time seeing a Akira Kurosawa film and I was told not to watch this as my first film since it is a very slow and Abstract type of film. but being one of many benighted people on Akira Kurosawa films, I wanted to be enlightened.\\nThere was an earlier film version of this story made in 1961 by director Agasi Babayan, but I could not find it anywhere so I had no choice but to watch this version.\\nIt is a very simplistic and Bland story involving a very ancillary type of camaraderie between Dersu Uzala and Vladimir Arseniev.\\nThe conundrum of this film is that it is very slow but then again that may have been the intentions of the director to make it the crux of the story.\\nIt seems to me that this director is very cryptic in his way of directing.

It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. Kurosawa takes you to the colorful and picturesque forests of Siberia; a treat to sore eyes.Dersu, a hunter in the forest, is a true son of the forest. He converses with all the life forms and treats them as fellow men with respect and fear. The soldiers ridicule his old-fashioned behavior but the captain sees him more than his customs- as a professional hunter and a guide. Dersu leads the troop into the Siberian forests, leaves them spellbound with his perfect aiming of the gun and his ever-alert ears that would sense even the faintest of the sounds. Dersu saves the life of the captain when they get lost and are caught in a fierce storm and the design of the cave-like-structure that saved captain's life further increases the admiration the captain has towards Dersu.Years later, the captain leads another troop on an exploration into the forest and the soldiers happen to meet Dersu. Dersu becomes a senile, crotchety codger and his sharp eyesight diminishes. He is persuaded by the captain to rest at his place in the town but he feels he doesn't fit among the fast-moving and weird world where people pay for water. He is later found dead after being killed by a thief who stole the gun gifted by the captain and the captain performs the obsequies in respect for their friendship.\",\"50\":\"It's been 24 hours since I watched this film. I went to bed thinking about it, and I woke up thinking about it. As I scroll through the 100 reviews on this site and see all the extremely high ratings and glowing review titles, I now know why so many accolades.This movie is about true brotherhood. It sincerely is the \\\"real deal\\\". If every adult on this planet adopted such a spirit of camaraderie and empathy and carried it through in their daily lives, as well as passing it on to their children, this world would be an amazing place to live. Sadly, it's a hostile one that seems to grow more hostile as the decades pass.If you have a dislike or aversion to subtitles or simply are not a fan of non-english-speaking films, try opening your mind and giving this movie a chance. It's divided into two parts, each about 70 minutes long. At least watch part one, and if you're not impressed, turn it off and you can at least say you tried. My guess is you'll be hooked and will watch it to the very end.\",\"51\":\"I term it as a 'masterpiece' ! Being a Nature adorant, the blissful AND intimidating aspects of the Nature were a treat for me. Sadly, there aren't many(any?) movies that focus on the mankind's ambitious projects like surveying but this movie has an adequate depiction of the perils faced by the surveyors. Dersu's skills alarmed the timid person inside me who has been afraid for years regarding the lack of survival skills if sent out away from the civilization ! The movie impeccably underlines the timeless truth - the one staying close and integrated with Nature, knows how the Life on the planet should be respected !!! The plot is strong, the actors have done their parts flawlessly and the cinematography is majestic. Dersu's instincts, the naive but warm-hearted and cheerful soldiers, the sober and emotional captain Arsenyev, the Chinese hermit all touch the Heart. At the beginning of the first expedition, the soldiers sing a song, then Dersu arrives and at the end of the expedition, they sing the same song and that is when the viewer realizes that it, in a way, depicts the hunter Dersu. When the captain is merry on meeting Dersu during the second expedition, the fellow soldiers sing a song about a grey(aging!) eagle which is a pleasant humor. Maxim Munzuk has portrayed all the simple, yet, deep emotions of a benevolent man living in the wilderness - the pangs of his family loss, the respect for Nature and other living beings, the shock and grief of loss of strength due to aging, a man from the wild feeling smothered in the civilization and the brave decision to go back to the wild even if it means death.Yes, one cannot ignore the perpetual dark mood of the film, I speculate it as a result of Kurosawa's melancholic and unstable mental state just before he begun directing the film. To summarize, the movie will go as a pearl in (my brain's memory)box ...\",\"52\":\"A Russian military squad, commanded by a Captain, explores the wilderness of Siberia on a mapping expedition. They encounter a man, Dersu Uzala, who is as much a part of the forest as the trees and the rivers and the elk and the tigers. At first amused by the man, the soldiers gain a deep respect for Dersu as he demonstrates a profound understanding of the forest, nature and survival. The Captain and Dersu form a close and lasting friendship.\\nMovies like this are rare in their simplicity and greatness. There is the adventure story of exploring the wilderness, which is realistic and entertaining. But the greatness of the movie is how it conveys the bond that forms between the Captain and Dersu. It is always so nice to come across a gem like Dersu Azala.\",\"53\":\"i have watched thousands of films and some are truly magnificent. this is the best film i have ever seen. i would have said that back in 1975 if IMDb had been around then. and no, i wasn't around during Tesla's time. this is a story of a man who didn't care if his good deeds were ever known, a man one with our mother earth. he was a simple, gifted, altruistic, spiritual man with grace and magnificence, and a human being that we can all aspire to be. this is an unforgettable film that all film buffs can try to see. the cinematography, art direction, acting, theme, score, screen play and direction are superlative and beyond description. Dersu is a man that any creator can be proud of. if we are space dust, then he is the shining star. thank you Mr Kurosawa. you are missed.\",\"54\":\"I saw Dersu Uzala originally when it was first released, and literally could not forget it. I was in my 20s, and had no idea who Akira Kurosawa was (and had seen none of his other films) at that time. As others have remarked, the quality of the DVD is merely passable --- it was better translated onto the small to medium screen when I saw it on celluloid at a Canadian community college library in the 70s. The Siberian setting is grandly portrayed. Further, the meeting of two cultures is exquisitely handled in its many complexities. We see this simple, initially misunderstood, man of the uncharted wilderness transformed from a near-simpleton in the eyes of the members of the Russian cartographic expedition, who initially have no idea at all what to make of him, into a genius of his trade, a supremely sympathetic and dependable human, and, ultimately, an entirely inspiring hero.While Dersu Uzala is my favourite of all of Kurosawa's films, it does not seem to be widely recognized as one of his important works. In fact, Kurosawa was struggling with depression when this film was made, and his mood set the tone, particularly at the conclusion of the film (which I think he might have done differently, had he been in better spirits). This was a Russian-Japanese co-production, accomplished, importantly, in the third decade of the Cold War. Through this film, I learned respect not only for Northern Manchurian aboriginal people, but also for Russians and their culture. (Dersu was ethnically Goldi or Nanai, a people of the Middle Amur Basin, of Northern Manchurian descent).This is a story with heart and soul, played out against one of the equally most beautiful and entirely ominous of natural settings I have encountered. My view and understanding of Siberia were transformed by this film, as was my appreciation for international cinema. Certainly, this film, Dersu Uzala, needs to be remastered and released on 4K --- and brought back to large screens in theatres, as well --- though I am not certain that will ever occur.\",\"55\":\"Kurosawa's genius has been fully outlined all over the IMDB so let me just add a few quips about this seldom discussed film.  First and foremost, one of the best nature films ever shot in 70mm and second, a refreshing handling of cosmotheism without grandstanding.  The creation and development of the character Dersu Uzala was stunning and Maksim Munzuk's portrayal brilliant.That being said, one point of contention.  For the wily Captain Vladimir Arseniev to lock Dersu down in the hell of a 20th century city simply because he needed glasses, bothered me when I saw this film fifteen years ago, and it stills bothers me today.  Oh sure, many would say chiding Kurosawa about that is like bringing up slaves and Jefferson but by God even Leo X used glasses to improve his hunting in the 16th Century!  Surly there was one affordable pair of spectacles in Eastern Russia in 1907.  Couldn't the tiger have ripped his leg off instead?\",\"56\":\"On the face of it, Dersu Uzala would not seem like a candidate for a great film. The story is about a young Russian (Imperial Russia) officer is sent to the far east of Siberia to explore. He meets with a native of the region and they form a bond together. The territory in question is the wild, rugged eastern Siberia (north of Valdivostok). I would say that you have not lived until you have seen what Kurosawa can do filming nature in its raw splendor and magnificence. The scenes in this film like the wind rushing through the tall reeds, or the mist draping the forested hills, are images of haunting beauty.Kurosawa, one of the greatest film directors of the 20th century, made his final masterpiece with film. The characters are well drawn, the sub-text of the story (the clash of civilization vs. nature) is nuanced, but most of all it is the wild beauty of nature which is the focus of this film. Once you see it, I don't think you will forget it, I know I never have.\",\"57\":\"After the box office failure of Dodes'ka-Den, Kurosawa was extremely depressed and attempted to commit suicide. After his recovery, he got over his depressive state and directed the Japanese\\/Russian co-production, Dersu Uzala.Set in the forests of Siberia in the 19th century, Dersu Uzala is one of the most important films about friendship ever made. It tells the story of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (Yuri Solomine) as he leads an expedition through the woods. While his group is camping one night, a small mountain man named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk) comes across the men and agrees to act as their guide. The friendship between Dersu and Vladimir grows over the years and Vladimir urges Dersu to return to the city with him but the latter always refuses. Finally Dersu agrees to go, but finds that it is a very difficult adjustment to make.This was the first Kurosawa film that I ever saw and it amazed me in so many ways. The beautiful landscapes, the well-developed characters, and most importantly, the great friendship between Dersu and Vladimir make this one of my favorite films.\",\"58\":\"Dersu Uzala is a surprising movie for me. It is the 13th Kurosawa film that I have seen, and to me it is so different from the rest of his work that I might not have guessed who the director was if I had simply stumbled upon it at random. For one, it is a Soviet-Japanese joint production, and is spoken entirely in Russian, not Japanese. There is no Mifune or Nakadai at the helm, but rather some relatively unknown actors, although talented nonetheless). There are no samurai that Kurosawa became known for, neither is it a noir-esquire type of film like High and Low or Stray Dog. And yet, among all these differences, it is one of the most beautiful films that Kurosawa created in my opinion. And to me, it is a different kind of beauty. It is a raw, pure beauty. The stunning cinematography adds so much to the story. Nature is alive in this film, from the crackling flames to the cascading rivers to the shredding winds, Dersu even refers to all these natural aspects as \\\"men.\\\" This film is not driven by ambiguous symbolism or a complex plot, but by strong themes and tremendous character development. One must be rather cold to not be affected by some of the heartwarming scenes. I have seen some call this film too slow or too long, and while Kurosawa definitely does exhibit a lot of patience in his shots, none of it is wasted. The relationship between the two primary characters is so well developed that I could not help but be captivated throughout the whole story. This is truly one of Kurosawa's most overlooked, under appreciated works. Kurosawa succeeds in telling a very touching tale without making it sentimental, but rather filled with a beauty that deserves to be witnessed.\",\"59\":\"This is one of my definite favorites.It tells a story of a man who is one with the wilderness and nature and cant live any other way.Dersu Uzala is an old Goldi(siberian asiatic minority) hunter who thinks he has been cursed after he kills a tiger.To him,every being,every part of the nature is equally worth as humans.The film gives us accounts of one Russian captain's friendship with Dersu.They are together through thick and thin and Dersu even rescues him from a blizzard when they are stuck on a frozen lake.Dersu has all the natural senses and therefore knows when he is in danger.He knows everything by looking and observing the landscape around him.So when he kills the tiger,its like a spell has been cast on him.Or is it just his imagination?His people believe in a ghost that rules the taiga,Kanga.He thinks Kanga will punish him in some way.Soon his fears start to get real.He cant kill his prey for food that he needs for living because his eyesight dramatically worsens.One frightening night(my favorite scene) it gets too much for him,listening to the howling wind in the dark,waiting for Kanga to send a tiger to kill him.And captain Arseniev,seeing the horror that struck him,offers him to come with him to his hometown.It happens so.Throughout the film,you cant help but wonder what will happen to Dersu.Not only because in the beginning Arseniev searches for his grave,in retrospection,but also because he is one lonely,sad man who lives only by hunting.There is no place for him but the taiga.And when the tragedy happens,its hard not to feel remorse and pity the old Dersu.His world has come crashing down.The end specially is painful and shows that there is no mercy in this world for a man who falls from grace in his own homeground.In the end,this film has outstanding photography,outstanding music,outstanding cast,beautiful scenery and do i need to say anything about the director? A  timeless work that can never be surpassed.\",\"60\":\"..and his name was Akira Kurosawa. Once upon a time there was a simple man: a hunter, and simple story of friendship and reflection about life. Once upon a time a magnificent director and film crew have put a beautiful story on the screen with such perfection, that in our days we look back and we wonder: why movies like this are not being made anymore??It doesn't matter if you like any other Kurosawa's works or any other 'Russian' films, because this one would touch you so much that you would go back and looked for similar films\\u00c2\\u2026 I wish I could see this film in all his beauty: on a big screen, in the original format (70 mm), as I felt that I missed a lot of details from the TV format.There are directors and there is Kurosawa, there are dramas and there are Russian stories, so when you put both of them together, what do you get? Dersu Uzala!Enjoy it, at least as much I did\",\"61\":\"\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" was my introduction to Kurosawa's work; since that time, I've probably seen somewhere between 7 and 10 of his other films. Some have been quite powerful, and I'd probably enjoy seeing them again. But Dersu Uzala is a love story -- about love of the land, and of two men; and tigers in Siberia! I can't give any better summaries of what's so magnificent about the filming and Kurosawa's genius than the other fan's comments have indicated. But where so many other of Kurosawa's films are about fighting and wars (like \\\"Ran\\\") -- this film has more of a lyric or pastoral quality to many scenes. If I ran the world -- if you've every played that game with your friends or with your kids -- if I ran the world, every great filmmaker, or novelist, would be required to write at least one film (or novel) about a person from another culture or another religion who inspired them, or taught them something unforgettable about the mysterious nature of life. Well, here's one of the greatest directors ever, and that's just what he's done here. Hats off to Akira-sensei, the humble master; may he live as long as Hokusai or longer, learning to the last minute.\",\"62\":\"I have liked the work of kurosawa and satyajit ray. Satyajit rays movies are most moving but now that i have seen dersu uzala. I would say It is the only movie that has ever brought down a smile and a tear in my eye. I am myself a filmmaker of course very small one but i have never been moved so many times in a single movie.To put in short this is the cinematic masterpiece a perfect example of how a simple story can be told in a way you cannot imagine. The cast of this film is perfect the acting better and the direction and screenplay are the best that has ever been. If you are a avid movie goer see this film, its not those boring art movies, or movies you think are experimental. Watch this if you too claim that you been never moved by a story.\",\"63\":\"Think of Kurosawa, and, most likely, you will think first of his Samurai epics. However, his genius stands apart from any particular genre, and this film is a stunning case in point.Faced with such unpromising material as a story about the friendship between a Russian army officer and an aging hunter, set in Siberia in the early 1900's, most film-makers would run screaming for cover. Kurosawa revels in the story, and creates a true cinematic masterpiece.While the heart of the film is the human relationship between the \\\"Capitan\\\" and Dersu, the main star of the film is the Siberian wilderness itself. Rarely can such loving care have been lavished on ensuring that the natural beauty of a location comes through onto the celluloid. Some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed: the group round the campfire with the river in the background and the wind whipping up; the sequence where the captain and Dersu have to cut reeds to make a shelter as night falls and a storm approaches; the night-time scene (I kid you not!) of the group dragging a sledge across an icy waste.The simple story of exploration, man versus nature, and the evolution of a true friendship is both thought-provoking and deeply touching. The tiny Maksim Munzuk is superb as the title character and Yuri Solomin is a study of restraint in the role of Captain Vladimir Arseniev (upon whose actual journals the story is based).This is one of those rare films that you can watch twice back-to-back, or at any time to restore your belief that, in addition to being a means of mass entertainment, movies really can be an art form as well.\",\"64\":\"Akira Kurosawa's \\\"Dersu Uzala,\\\" winner of the 1975 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, is as heartwarming as a cartoon from Disney's golden era, but only the title character can understand the talking trees and animals.Filmed in Russian in the Soviet Union, \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" has the distinction of being the only film Kurosawa made outside Japan. Released in 1975, it was made at a time when the Japanese film industry was beginning to discover that children's movies were cheaper and easier to produce, thanks to the low-cost of animation and a less discerning audience ensuring a reasonable return on the studios' investment. The studios, concerned only with profit and not the artistic merit of films, could no longer justify the bloated costs of Kurosawa's epics. This signaled the beginning of the end for the Tokyo film industry, which once rivaled Hollywood and Paris in terms of innovation and quality, and eventually changed the Japanese aesthetic to kawaii (cutesy). Kurosawa would later depend upon foreign patrons to finance his films, such as George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Spielberg. And in the case of \\\"Dersu Uzala,\\\" the Soviet Union.The film is based on the 1923 travelogue, \\\"Dersu the Trapper\\\" by V.K. Arseniev, which explains why it doesn't follow a conventional story line. The story is basically broken into three parts. The first part is an account of Arseniev's exploration of the Ussuri basin in the Russian Far East. He and his men encounter a Nanai trapper named Dersu Uzala, and commission him to be their guide. At first Dersu is like a magical woodland spirit. Speaking awkward Russian, his world-view is considered quaint to the Soviets, but engenders him with a brand of common sense he needs to survive in the wilderness. Dersu saves Arseniev's life several times.The second part of the story picks up a few years later when Arseniev is making another survey of the Ussuri basin. He runs into Dersu again by chance, and again hires him to be his guide. Dersu is growing older now, and is becoming too senile to survive on his own in the wilderness. Here he relies on Arseniev to save him. Where Dersu came off as the stereotypical \\\"noble savage\\\" in the first part, he now seems more fallible and human.The third and final part is a fish-out-of-water story, as Dersu, believing the wilderness has grown hostile to him, moves to the city to live with Arseniev's family.While something of an oddball in Kurosawa's catalog, the film still has the director's distinctive style. Kurosawa uses his characteristic long takes, in which he leaves the camera stationary and allows the acting to dictate where the viewers' eyes should look.\\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is not just beautiful for its cinematography, but also for its touching human relationships. Arseniev and Dersu come from two different worlds, and they will never be able to fully understand each other. However, they find friendship in each other despite their differences.Unfortunately the U.S.S.R. allowed 20 minutes to be cut out of this 141- minute epic for the Italian release without consulting Kurosawa, which turned off the director from ever making a film outside Japan again.While certainly not Kurosawa's best film, this sweet, but unusual tale is worthy of the director's better-known classics.\",\"65\":\"Even though in many of the other writeups, there is said that it is a sad tale and not real easy to watch. I don't think so. It is my belief that the story of Dersu had to end as it did. The alternative: the broken down old Chinaman at the beginning of the story. How far do you think he got walking out of Siberia in the winter? I belive the Chinaman knew exactly what was going to happen. And, as so often in the character of Dersu Uzala you find that he thought of others instead of himself. I believe that the Chinaman surrendered his home to otheres because he knew his time was at an end, anyway. He could no longer support himself in the woods.That character trait is what made Dersu so appealing to us and to his \\\"Captain.\\\" Dursu was completely in tune with his humanity even though most people would look at him in Russian society as a barbarian. He always knew what to do and what was best in the woods. Which is actually a great deal like what the rest of the world really is, and what is best for the whole world. However, modern society, as we all know, will not embrace Dersu's beliefs. We will not give even though we have no use for the item, Dersu did. And, Dersu gave often when he could have used the item, remember the leaving of food in the shelter for others who might be in need.SLIGHT SPOILER: The death of Dersu Usala was somehow correct. It is well that it happened as soon as it did as he went to converse with the Chinaman. Dersu didn't have to suffer. Dersu could no longer survive in the woods. Modern society had no place for him as he could not support its behavior. Dersu was honest about life, about himself, and saw things absolutely clearly. It is sorta sad that a gift caused his demise but as I said above, he possibly gave him a more humane death that the slow starvation he was facing.  The only real sadness is that his grave was lost to someone who truly loved him.  It is an absolutely beautiful story that is true to its characters. It is really sad that Hollywood cannot bring out stories about the goodness in humanity rather than how to kill each other with as much flashy aplomb as possible.  As near a perfect film as I have ever seen.\",\"66\":\"I own many of Akira Kurosawa's films. I have Ran, Throne of blood, Seven Samarai, Roshomon, Dreams, Hidden Fortress, Jojimbo, Snajuro, Red Beard, and even \\\"Kurosawa\\\" the documentary. I guess you can say that I like his work. The \\\"Kurosawa\\\" documentary narrated by Sam Shepard and produced by thirteen \\/ WNET I recommend for anyone at all interested in Kurosawa's films as it will really wet your appetite.Of all of his films, Dersu Uzala is my favorite. It is also one of my favorite films by anybody. It was done shortly after Akira had went through a very dark time in his life and had attempted suicide. It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But, I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals, and that is what feels good.Many of Kurosawa's films have a great deal of spectacle, and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films, he could not feel that he was living. As a result, he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director's true personality. Just perhaps, it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again, it is my favorite.\",\"67\":\"I heard that there are still people who haven't watched Dersu Uzala.While researching a distant forest, a researcher from the Russian army encounters the wise Dersu Uzala, who understands the language of nature. This encounter reminds the researcher of the meaning of nature and friendship and equips him with new knowledge.In the film, which has a strong cinematography, we experience all emotions in a realistic way with the director's wonderful use of nature, thanks to this, our bond with the characters is strengthened and we feel the empathy to the bone.This movie, which is a masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa, has its name written in golden letters in the history of cinema, and received the 1976 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. 8.5\\/10\",\"68\":\"It's impossible to name the greatest movie Akira Kurosawa has directed, but it just might be this one.. But it also might be for example Ran or Ikiru, and I haven't mentioned Rashomon or Seven Samurai yet.Well there's still something special about Dersu, not only that it's made in USSR and it's filming took years, it has something unique powers. It still has it's Kurosawa elements. The scene where Dersu and Captain are struggling against the storm, is one of the most powerful.Dersu is a hunter, who lives in Siberia, and a Russian expedition meets him. A special bond is created between Captain and Dersu. They separate when the expedition's have to return home. Dersu couldn't live anywhere else than in the nature. But they meet again when Captain and his crew returns..In the beginning of the movie, you'll see what is going to happen eventually, but the story that is told is beautiful and touching. You'll return to watch this movie again sometime if you just manage to watch it once.\",\"69\":\"Like Nora Inu (Stray Dog), High and Low, and Ikiru, Akira Kurosawa looks deep into the soul of man in Dersu Uzala.  This movie, however, has another plus: The scenery, filmed in Siberia. Outstanding film!Despite the cast of actors unknown to westerners, this film is very much a Kurosawa vehicle, with its deep looks into the hearts of both Uzala and the Captain in their original meeting, and years later.This ranks as one of my favorite Kurosawa films.  It's at least as good as Do Des Ka Den and some of the others that portray the inner workings of men in conflict with their world.\",\"70\":\"This movie is one the best movies that shows how someone who lives in the wilderness knows how to survive in a realistic manner. No overtop skills or plot amor.\",\"71\":\"This movie ranks within my top 5. It weaves together all elements of the art of film. Similar to Atanarjuat you do not feel to view an outside perspective. The movie is beautiful, hopeful and sad.\\nOutwardly it displays the mistreatment of nature and native cultures by modern society. Inwardly, however, it seems to be a reminder of how we ignore proper thinking and acting by clinging to greed and anger.\",\"72\":\"Yes, it sounds corny, but \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\" is (to me) really a love story as well as one of friendship; I cannot think of a more complete, platonic love between two friends. Just think of the scene in which Dersu and the \\\"Capitan\\\" spy one another through the dense woods, reunited after years, and rush towards one another, shouting each other's names. It was a giddy moment, and tearful.As much as these two very different men bond, they remain different. Though Arseniev is changed dramatically by Dersu's influence (as are his men, to some extent), Dersu remains pretty much the same. He is organic, part of his wild environment, as much as the trees, rivers or animals. His inner thoughts, though partly understood by Arseniev, remain largely a mystery to the sensitive Captain. In some ways, I think the latter likes this better than knowing all about Dersu, as if he ever could.Much has been made of the stunning scenery and Kurosawa's \\\"lingering\\\" way of filming it, which was so perfect. There were also very intense scenes, in which the two men were pitted against the very active forces of nature, such as a snowstorm and a raging river, not to mention the mysterious and symbolic tiger that stalks them. Add to all that the humor that bubbles up regularly, from both men, usually in surprise at the odd way the other does things, and you have a very dynamic film, despite its apparent tranquility. One of my favorite scenes is the Christmas encampment, in which the men have decorated a tree with various things like tin cans, forks and even chunks of ice. It signifies the turning point, especially for Dersu. At first it is comical, but this is also when he becomes obsessed with the tiger's \\\"ghost\\\".I can't imagine anyone finding the pace of this film \\\"slow\\\"; it is just right. Any faster and we would have \\\"The Edge\\\" instead (which makes me wonder if some of that was inspired by \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\"). Not that the latter film was bad--I actually like it quiet a bit--but it is no \\\"Dersu Uzala\\\"; few films ARE.-SPOILER- I agree with the person who wrote that Dersu's death seems appropriate; for, once his sight was almost gone, how could he live in his natural environment? And he could not handle modern, city life. It was the only way out for him, though quite sad. To me, it symbolized the death of the old hunter-gatherer culture across the world, and the \\\"triumph\\\" of industrialization. Even Arseniev, despite his respect for Dersu, makes no attempt to change his modern lifestyle to go live in the wild. He is content to be part of the 20th Century.The fact that the two men bond so deeply WITHOUT becoming like one another or trying to imitate each other to any great extent, is what makes this a love story, I think, and a tragic one. They know that they can never live in one another's worlds for long, try as they may.Some have compared Dersu Uzala to Yoda, but I think the old man would laugh at this. Unlike Yoda, he did not seem to see himself as particularly special, which was part of his charm. He reminds me more of Jeremiah Johnson or later, Lt. Dunbar, or better yet, Kicking Bird in \\\"Dances with Wolves\\\". He craves simplicity and merely living off the land, not wisdom, nor even enlightenment, as Westerners see it. Perhaps that's because he already has it.\",\"73\":\"Dersu Uzala is slow, serene, beautiful, but nevertheless gripping. It tells of the friendship between a nomadic Siberian native and a Russian army explorer, and how the former is able to help the latter and his team to negotiate the many obstacles presented by the Siberian wilderness. We see how traditional survival methods and intrinsic common sense can help the more urbanised army men to cope with the extremes of climate and geography. Eventually the nomad is persuaded to join the general on his trip back to a town. His ignorance of urban life is apparent, but interesting nevertheless, as we do not imagine such people nor meet them in everyday life today. Kurosawa is on top form here, letting the camera take in the vastness of Siberia, and still allowing the viewers to observe the characters closely. The story is interesting too, with a sadly ironic ending (won't say any more!). I think everybody should watch this film, because everybody will have something to learn from it.\",\"74\":\"Kurosawa is first and foremost, a story-teller. Through his stories we see much of ourselves--who we are, can be, the limits of our ethos and preconceived notions of who we are or capable of. Kurosawa amazes us with his range. Stories set in contemporary Japan. Ancient Japan. From businessmen to detectives to .... a strong little man living alone in the most desolate land on earth--Siberia. It is based on memoirs? of a Russian Army Captain who encountered Dersu at the end of the 19th century, when Russia was still mapping what it was--something that George Washington did when our country was unexplored. The story, of course, cannot avoid the necessary comparison of modern man with paleolithic nomadic man. What is good, evil, the measure of men specific to one's time. What senses have we lost or have been dulled by living in cocoons of civilization, warm houses and shared responsibility for warding off cruel nature and the creatures who inhabit the shadows outside the firelight. How important are fire, salt, matches, ammo.... all precious things that should be husbanded and even left in forest shelters for those who might need them in times of privation and soul lost wandering. Dersu says, \\\"You bad man!\\\" and \\\"You very good man.\\\" and sometimes to the same man! He sees that no man is either all good or evil, but is capable in each moment of becoming either. We see men whose\\\"normal\\\" lives in civilization were shattered, and they went out into the wilderness to die or live, and let the gods determine their fate. I fell in love with this movie. And I laugh at many of us--the most modern and out-of-touch with nature: nature as beauty and as cruel harvester of our bodies when we can no longer push headlong into the dark blizzard. Now, so many of us dishonor the remaining tigers, bears, apex predators and a world seemed too green and gauzy and nonthreatening to so many. Why not go for a jog in the Colorado mountains? How many are killed, eaten by mountain lions, because they didn't respect nature as she is. Bears, wolves--why they won't hurt you if you but sit and gaze upon them with zen-like concentration--I fear you not, my brother. Yet this movie shows that we need not hate what ultimately comes to take us away to that land from in no traveler returns. The tiger is a god. And when one cannot kill him, clean and swift, and he runs away, then the gods say you will die soon. Not just a pretty creature to aim one's camera or rifle at and sigh. Or that fool in Herzog's \\\"Grizzly Man\\\". Anyone who knows the out of doors and the power nature still has over us, can only laugh at the idiot who pranced and danced amongst the grizzlies. Well, joke's on you, mister. It just so happened your hubris and modern sensibilities and lies you've told yourself about nature came around to bite you..... et' you.Dersu Uzala is the divine opposite of Herzog's either ironic or stupid \\\"Grizzly Man\\\". Nature was neither a winter playground or an ugly place at all. For Dersu reveled in the smells, sounds and cornering winds that made the fire become something different with each poke of an ember reddened stick. Where life is now in the living. And nature is neither Disneyland nor a living hell, but is the relentless earth, moiling and seething, buckling up and taking one finally, in the end. A superb movie that should be seen by many many more folk.\",\"75\":\"This film depicts the breathtaking beauty of the soul as adeptly as that of nature.  The story reminded me how profoundly any one person can effect another, even without realizing it: an important reminder in the midst of the information age, which seems to be desensitizing people to our relationships with nature and with our fellow man.How ironic, that the vast, forbidding landscapes of Siberia host the birth of a true friendship, while the warm confines of the  city stifle the passion for life!  I don't believe Kurosawa is denouncing modern times entirely; I believe he's reminding us that true sophistication comes from the depths of the soul, not of the pocketbook.While similar in theme to \\\"Being There,\\\" \\\"Forrest Gump,\\\" or \\\"The Rain Man,\\\" Dersu Uzala is superior, because unlike the subjects of those films, the central character here is merely not well-educated, as opposed to mentally deficient.  Kurosawa must have been too lofty a soul, to suggest spiritual simplicity is a result of a defect.Dersu Uzala is a celebration of love and innocence everyone should see.\",\"76\":\"Before today I never heard of this film, and I only watched it because I was required to for a college course. In fact while watching the movie I found it rather boring. It was only by the end of the movie and through analyzing the film that I have come to discover its pure genius. This movie is a work of Art. The landscapes are amazing and the interaction between the captain and Uzala are in creditable. Add on top of that an amazing underlying story and an ending that unfortunately, correctly sums up the movie perfectly. In today's society there is no place for someone of Uzala's character.Pure Genius\",\"77\":\"When the movie ends and your breath still can't calm down and you want to share what you've just seen with the closest ones... it deserves 10.Definitely not the perfect action\\/adventure. But I don't suppose it was meant to be such.\\\"People\\\", he repeated all the time - \\\"people\\\" were everywhere. People were the soldiers, people were the trees, the fire, the wind, the beasts in the wood...It amazed me enormously the idea of a man so well living with the nature (not \\\"in\\\"), so respecting it that it has been turned into a part of him.A great example of how surviving does not make you necessarily mean and angry man. ...But a truly loving one.\",\"78\":\"Everyone else has already provided the details of what makes this film beautiful and intense.My only fault with it is why didn't the Captain get Dersu some glasses instead of or in combination with the new rifle.\",\"79\":\"Kurosawa is one of the great story tellers of all time. If he had been living a thousand years ago he would have been the one that created fables and legends. There is often a moral in his work and there is always a portrait of humanity. In Dersu this is more naked than ever as it focuses on just two people, the Captain, a Russian military surveyor and a clever old hunter called Dersu Uzala. They are set against a backdrop of the harsh, but stunning Siberian landscape. This is where we get to see the beauty of Kurosawa's direction with his amazing ability to paint skies with his camera and make you feel the cold wind blowing across the land. Dersu and his Captain quietly wander the forests charting the land. The unspoken communication between them and the feeling of immense respect that grows is warming.  A truly magical story.\",\"80\":\"Akira Kurosawa, the masterful director of this humble epic, was in a dark place before the making of 'Dersu Uzala'. His last two movies had become big flops at the box-office and he could not get investors for his next projects. As a result Kurosawa became depressed and tried to commit suicide. Eventually the Soviets would breathe life into his career again by inviting him to direct 'Dersu Uzala'. It is a simple story about humanity, humbility and the forces of nature.We follow around the captain of a Russian expedition team, tasked with exploring the Siberian wilderness. During their travels they encounter upon a man who lives completely isolated in the harsh and brutal evironment that surrounds them. At first the Russians laugh at their new travel companion, unbeknowing to the vast wisdom he embodies. Later on they would depend on his knowledge of the natural forces and eventually love him for the great man he is.Before us grows a relationship that would become the best of friendships. Two men bound by eachother to survive whatever mother nature throws at them and with great prevail. The captain and the wise man get caught in a blizzard and what happens next is a battle of life and death between man and nature. For minutes on end we see two men cutting through high grass in an attempt to get through the night, companioned by nothing more but the sounds of their panting and increasing exhaustion.\\nThey come out of the blizzard as best friends who owed their lives to one another and in a warm embrace they show their admiration to eachother. It has become one of the most nail biting but rewarding moments I have ever encountered in cinema.The two man would part ways eventually. With the wise man unable to live in the city he chooses to stay behind in the wilderness. As they part they look around to get a last look at the other. 'Kapitan!', 'Dersu' they yell, both hoping they will see eachother again and so does the audience.Years later the captain goes on another expedition and, as faith have it, the men find eachother again. Once again Dersu would navigate them through the wild and once again they would save eachothers lives by surviving a rafting accident in a fast-flowing river. They had become ore than best friends, they were companions by fate. Dersu who has grown old and aggitated by his decreasing hunting skills, chooses to join the captain in the city. Unable to live the life he wants, because of his failing eye-sight, he becomes unhappy. Dersu belongs in the wilds and both he and the captain know it. They say goodbye one last time, with the captain handing Dersu a new and better rifle. The next we hear is that a dead man needs to be identified in the wilderness. We hope it is not true, but we know that it is. One of the investigators suggests that he was killed because someone wanted his rifle, a bitter end to the best of connections.Dersu Uzala is celebration of nature, life and friendship. A humanist masterwork that could only been directed by Kurosawa at the lowest point in his life. Many of the wisdom Dersu teaches reminds me of Taoism. A philosophy build on listening to the forces of nature and giving in to the flow of the universe. We get a grasp at the vast beauty that the wild contains, but also a look at her harsh mood-swings.\",\"81\":\"DERSU UZALA just blew me away. Set prior to the Russian revolution it tells a deceptively simple story of a small band of Russian soldiers on a challenging mission to survey a Siberian wilderness that's forbidding in summer and absolutely treacherous in winter.Fortunately for them, along the way they encounter Derzu Uzala, a little man who lives his life alone, at one with the forest and its creatures, and who agrees to serve as guide for the expedition. He's at one with his surroundings; he refers to animals and plants and stones and everything else in his world as \\\"men;\\\" he's short; he's initially perceived to be a fool but it turns out he's incredibly strong and capable and wise; he can handle a weapon more skillfully than any of the soldiers -- it's almost as though the Force is with him. Yes, I realized when I heard (read) his mangled syntax that Artoo and Threepio clearly weren't the only characters George Lucas lifted from an Akira Kurosawa movie.But that's a side issue. This film is gorgeous and gripping: I was hooked from the opening scene and I hung onto every small thing that happened from then on. And really, in this film only small things happen, but they add up to an epic tale of nature and the ultimate wonder and tragedy of life itself. And it's all set against the backdrop of breathtaking Siberia.My only regret about seeing this wonderfully photographed film is that I didn't see it on a huge screen in a proper movie theater. The Kino DVD transfer just made me sad. There sat the movie on my widescreen TV like a pitiful postage stamp surrounded by an ocean of black border. Sure, I could enlarge the picture to fit side to side, but then the subtitles were chopped off at the bottom. I think Kino could have done better and I hope Criterion will someday give this film the loving care it deserves.\",\"82\":\"This is a great movie. As noted by other reviewers, the cinematography is fantastic. I saw it on DVD on a large screen and it was majestic. My comment is not so much on the movie effects and the acting, all of which has Kurosawa's signature of an art film, but on the complicated message that it weaves. So complicated that it is hard to see if you watch the film once. Ursu is a clever man because he knows the forest, but in the city he is not clever at all. On the contrary, he stumbles on inane things such as paying for water to the water delivery man, or trying to fire his rifle in the middle of the city or trying to camp on a curbside. It is as if the man is very good in certain contexts and not good at all in other contexts. Now, if you think about it, the same can be said of any one you know, unless he happens to be Albert Schweitzer. The Being is the sum of a man and his milieu. Captain Arseniev is not very good in the forest. He makes many mistakes and Ursu must lend his helping hand on many occasions to save poor captain from his own follies. In the city he seems to be doing OK, with a nice house, a beautiful wife and a real cute boy. So what would the good captain think is good for Ursu? Obviously, what is also good for him: city life. And he takes the man who saved his life to the city, to his house, but that breaks the sum of man and milieu, and the Being becomes miserable. Then the captain finally gets it and lets Ursu go back to his world of hunting in the forest he loves so much. But the captain botches it up again. To express his love for Ursu, he gives him a great rifle and that will bring death on Ursu because other greedy people would kill Ursu to get his rifle. Captain Arseniev knows that Ursu's eyesight is going downhill so a great rifle would not do as much good as a pair of glasses. Captain Arseniev also knows that the forest is inhabited by evil people and has seen the damage and pillaging that nasty guys to do animals and people in the forest. But he sends a half-blind mind with a valuable possession to a place infested with thieves. The end was easy to predict: Ursu will be killed by thieves who want his rifle, which is exactly what the bureaucrat at the crime scene tells Arseniev. The moral of the story is that you should not try to make other people happy with things that make you happy, unless you both share the milieu where the happiness occur. Arseniev should have learned to appreciate the Being, the sum of man and milieu, rather than the man alone. Kurosawa is inviting us to be more thoughtful when we try to do good.\",\"83\":\"This movie literally made me develop a bit of annoyance (to be polite) towards Hollywood movies. Every time I am set to watch a drama, there are few movies that come to my mind which set my expectation. But post this movie, this is the one that comes first to my mind. This has also helped me distinguish clearly between American culture and Asian culture (European here) and what to expect and what not to from Hollywood movies. Don't mean to write off Hollywood movies entirely. There are multiple masterpieces there and I continue to watch and re-watch many of them. However, very clearly, as Robert Altman once said while reviewing Rashomon, Hollywood probably portrays everything with the same causal and logical relationship but in an American setting with American characters portraying American culture, spoken language and body language. That really is the distinction which brings out, in all its glory, the Great American Arrogance (GAA).At the outset, great script, great cinematography, clinical direction, engrossing background score and performances by the actors that does justice to all the technicians' efforts.A bit of background about the movie - might not be new for Kurosawa fans. Kurosawa, after a series of failed movies from later 1960s to early 1970s, Kurosawa unsuccessfully attempted suicide. Thereafter Kurosawa set to work on a film based on a novel by a Russian explorer. Shot for more than a year under extremely harsh conditions, this movie won the Oscars in the foreign language film category apart from many other wins at various film festivals. This marked the re-entry of a master.The movie's beauty or its backbone is in the characterization. To verbally narrate this as a story to someone could be boring and futile as the impact lies in the characters and the screenplay. Extremely adorable characterization of the hunter. He would make you want to be like him or meet someone like him. He would make you think that such God-hearted souls exist only in the wilds away from the cynical and hypocrytic man-made parts of the world. In fact there is a similar line in the movie where the army men discuss that people like Dersu can be found only in the wilds. The character of the Captain is also extremely important as his thoughts and body-language impress upon the viewers Dersu's selflessness (viewers can see that the Captain literally admires him). Both these characters make the movie what it is.The movie is simply about what happens over a few days between a few Russian army men, their captain and a hunter in the Siberian forests. No real start nor finish. Nothing like a specific mission, specific event, specific incident, specific life story, etc. Yet it will totally have you in grips and you wouldn't want to get up before completely watching this movie and until you've seen what happens to the sweet characters in the movie and the relationship between them.At the risk of sounding tangential and biased \\/ prejudiced I must compare, at a very high level, 2 Hollywood movies that quickly come to my mind with Dersu Uzala. Shawshank Redemption and Bucket List. Granted that both have a completely different theme and talk about something different. Yet there is a very striking similarly and a commonality. Both of them are about friendship between 2 adult men and mature. While I don't have much to talk about the portrayal of relationships in the 2 movies as that is purely driven by what the movies called for, I would merely compare the characterization which is what I came to realize as the GAA. While the character of Morgan Freeman in both movies is almost comparable (in terms of his personality and composure) to that of Yuri Solomin (who plays the Captain in this movie), the real difference is seen in the characterization of Jack Nicholson and Tim Robbins in Bucket List and Shawshank Redemption respectively. Both exude a bit to extreme levels of arrogance. And this difference is also seen in the characterization of support roles. This characterization, if not the comparison, is very important as that is really the highlight of this movie for which you'll fall in love with it.This movie reinforces Kurosawa's view of humanity and how he sees the world today. This is one of the movies that can have a lasting impact on one's personality (it did on mine). Fans of pure drama movies MUST watch this. 10\\/10.\",\"84\":\"Based on the journals of Tsarist officer Vladimir Arseniev who set out at the end of the 19th Century to explore and map some of the wildest and most hostile areas of Russian territory - the Sino-Soviet border regions of the Siberian Taiga. The story unfolds when he meets the wise and enigmatic Dersu, a nomadic hunter, who quickly becomes his guide and friend. They remain companions through several expeditions and Arseniev owes his life to Dersu, whose understanding of nature and the elements saves them both on more than one occasion.Kurosawa plays the familiar theme of the struggle of man against the implacability of nature beautifully. The narrative may sometimes meander, but Dersu is brilliantly played by Maksim Munzuk, who portrays the lonely and fiercely independent hunter as tender and humorous, and Kurosawa misses no opportunity to indulge in long, sweeping takes of the breathtaking scenery. A poignant gem.NB George Lucas apparently based the character of Yoda on Dersu.\",\"85\":\"This is a masterpiece beyond belief. Yes, it is a very minimalist and simple story. Yet nothing is more difficult than simplicity.\",\"86\":\"The stunning Siberian scenery in this movie is probably the only glimpse of this remote region that most people will ever see, and a place where few humans have ever been. A beautiful story of friendship between a Mongolian hunter who lives there and a Russian soldier who is part of a team surveying the area. Each one is a stranger in the other one's world but gets to experience it. Which ultimately is more brutal--the wilderness or civilization ? Probably the best story of friendship that I have ever seen. The ending is very moving. Won the Oscar for best foreign movie.\",\"87\":\"Dersu Uzala is without a doubt one of the best films I have seen.  It is a film that haunts me still.  It is a story of a lone hunter that befriends some explorers and guides them through the wilderness of Siberia.The cinematography is spectacular (Kurosawa--need I say more?) and the story is so well told.  The story is both obvious and subtle at the same time. The old man guides them and they survive.  Also the old man represents the ways of the hills--even represents the hills and wilderness itself--and we see how he fails to fit in with civilization and progress.  It is a story of great triumph and great sorrow.  It it does not move you, then you are truly dead inside.\",\"88\":\"This movie is slow paced and uneventful, and yet it held my complete, captivated attention for the duration of the movie, leaving me wanting more and wishing it wasn't over so soon. The story is simple, touching, and sweet, and you can't help falling in love with the characters and natural surroundings. There are a few moments of suspense and danger, with modest amounts of tension, but the highlight of this movie is a character study of two men who form an unlikely friendship. I don't have much to say about the movie itself other than to give it my full recommendation. It has a certain innocent charm reminiscent of certain Chinese films from the 80s and 90s (Zhang Yimou and Wu Tian-Ming come to mind). This is truly a hidden treasure in the Kurosawa filmography!\",\"89\":\"Thats was one most amazing friendship story I ever seen! Dersu is a Nice person With a genuine heart. His soul is simple, and your sinergy With the captain its lovefull! A touchfull movie...with a great cinematography and amazing directing by Kurosawa!\",\"90\":\"There are many more movies about frienship, but I can't say I have ever seen one like this. The movie is a beautiful movie about the friendship and much more. It provides a great image of different cultures, different approaches to the same situation\\/area, it is unpredictable and manages to stay interesting really well.\",\"91\":\"When I feel lost I know that the only that I have to do is put The Dersu's cassette in my video and wait two hours. After this story I feel in a different way my stupid loneliness, I become a man in a big space.\",\"92\":\"Dersu Uzala is an interesting look at how two men (one a Russian military officer working for the geological survey, the other an Asiatic gold-hunter\\/guide) of different cultures change while living through trying experiences.  Commendable development of both the Captain and Dersu.  Great cinematography of a bleak area.  If you like it, keep an eye out for other Kurosawa films!\",\"93\":\"This one is an incredible film from Kurosawa. Filmed in natural scenarios with natural light, brings you a very special set of feelings i have never seen in other films. It transports you to the middle of the forests, the mountains and the rivers of the Siberia, a place close to the border between Russia, China and Korea in the 19th century. A team of Russian army explorers leaded by Capitain Arseniev, met with Dersu, a native hunter. The decide to continue their path together. The film shows the everyday experiences and how a real friendship born. I feel very fortunate because i first saw this movie on a theater and then i bought it on DVD. Is that kind of movies that once seen stay with you forever. If you have the chance of watching it on a theater don't miss it.David\",\"94\":\"Everything about this film is beautiful.  The locations (in Siberia) and the relationships that develop are brought together in a construct that without even raising one's pulse, manages to pull one's full attention.It is certainly a film for the sentimental type although anyone can enjoy it with a little application.  It is by no means and easy film to watch but if you apply yourself to reading into the nuances and the feel of the film then you will enjoy it.  I think that it is a film that has even more of an impact now as it describes a life that is foreign beyond belief to the western world.If you appreciate the beauty of cinematography then this is a must see.\",\"95\":\"While at first for me it was a bit strange watching a Kurosawa film that didn't have Japanese actors or language (it's not a racist comment, I don't think; seeing his staging and framing without Japanese people, if you've seen a lot of his films can be a bit off- putting at first) the movie grows on you and you start to accept everything that's being chucked at you.The characters of Arseniev and Dersu are just pleasant to watch. You feel they really care for each other, as Arseniev is very accepting and understanding of the way of live that he has never confronted before in meeting Dersu. They just get along so well and love and respect each other so much and in every way, it's hard not to like watching them interact and go through situations together.You never see Dersu without Arseniev close to him in his life (either in context of their lives or physically), as the story is told from Arseniev's perspective, the years which Dersu wanders as Arseniev briefly returns to society in the middle of the film remains untold; but you do see Arseniev in the absence of Dersu (even if only for brief lapses) but you do feel the absence and wait in anxiety for Dersu to make his way back into the story.There's one bit at the beginning of the 2nd segment of the film, where Arseniev is told by one of his men that he came across a hunter, but when the hunter asked the name of the leader of his unit he was not allowed by regulations to tell him who his commander is, Arseniev then rushes into the forest and in frame there is a far off speck of a man climbing through the brush and as you hear Arseniev shout \\\"Dersu!\\\" hearing Dersu reply, \\\"Captain!\\\" as they rush to hug each other is just such a heartfelt moment. Towards the end of the film, Dersu's eyesight fails and accepts that he cannot keeping living off the woods like he has his whole life and Arseniev offers him a place in his own home, back in the city, which Dersu accepts. After a time, it becomes apparent to both of them that Dersu's soul is being broken as he tries to adapt to society and he cannot live as freely as he's used to, so he breaks the news to Arseniev that he must go back to the forest. Arseniev without saying a word, walks offscreen and goes upstairs and brings back his new rifle of the latest model and gives it to Dersu without a second thought. And the fact that Arseniev is so accepting of Dersu's choice and doesn't take offense to his leaving but accepts his decision and supports him is the heart of the movie.The movie seems to be about the end of an era and in the ever- progressing society that we live in, Arseniev discovers this life- force that walks to the beat of it's own drum even as everything progresses and becomes more civilized. Well that's how I explain the beginning of the movie and everything that follows.The cinematography and the editing are gorgeous, by the way. And, of course, the direction. The lighting CAN be a bit BIT outdated, like when they film night scenes by the campfire, but it's such a good movie anyway.\",\"96\":\"Dersu Uzala has remained my favorite movie from the time I first saw it.  I don't think the movie has a single weakness, from plot to visualization, to acting to social relevance.Although Kurosawa is one of my favorite directors, this film is like nothing else he has done.  It is the simple story of a Russian military surveying party around the turn of the century that has the task of surviving far eastern Siberia.  Early in the course of the survey they meet Dersu, an ethnic Goldi who hunts in the forests for a living.  The friendship that develops between the head of the party, Arseniev, and the Goldi is one of the most beautiful stories of cross-cultural interaction I have ever seen.After seeing the film, I was very impressed with the story line, but I was thinking that he had been perhaps a bit overdramatic in his script, including more dangerous incidents than he needed to, and it might seem melodramatic to some people.  Some years later while browsing in the library, I came across a book by Arseniev called Dersu, and sure enough it was the \\\"real life\\\" story that Kurosawa had based his script on.  What was most surprising was that Kurosawa had actually understated the dangers faced by Arseniev and his surveying party in that there were several incidents that he had left out.I suspect that there are no Goldis like Dersu remaining in the far eastern forests of Siberia today, that they have been long since overrun by the \\\"superior\\\" cultures of the Russians and Chinese.  But this movie remains a powerful testimonial to what will be lost as we continue to try to assimilate the remaining ethnic minorities with little regard to the special gifts they can offer.\",\"97\":\"I think this is one of the worst Kurosawa movies with a very slow rhythm and also an aimless story. In fact its a common fact that every body gets old and the oldness has its special problems. To be a logical person it was not my favorite movie but its necessary to watch it in order to realize the difference between a good and a bad movie. End of the story has also a terrible finish. You would better to watch.\",\"98\":\"While I agree with all the glowing preceding praise, it's worth noting that no part of this story takes place in the taiga, nor even in Siberia. It's set in Primorsky Krai or north of there near the Amur River and Sea of Japan. That's well north of Korea, and possibly Manchuria, but east and south of Siberia. In fact, it's south of nearly any other bit of Russia. If you look, the forest is thick wet hardwoods and the plains are full of water. Tigers are everywhere. Men sleep outside in winter and don't trust ice. That isn't steppe; that isn't taiga; that's nowhere near tundra. That's temperate maritime jungle. Nor is the setting Kurosawa's invention, it's in the book. Part of the appeal in Russia was probably because it so graphically describes a province most Russians never see, dramatically different from the severe and sparse landscapes west of there. The combination of proximity to the Sea of Japan and latitude of the Black Sea makes it Russia's banana belt. Beautiful yes, taiga no.\",\"99\":\"One important issue was yet not touched in previous reviews - it's the Vladimir Arseniev books, that became Kurosawa's Dersu Uzala story. Not just memoirs or journal, but books that were written by Vladimir Arseniev based on his experience as an explorer of Sikchote Alin. These books were and still remain popular and well known in Russia. The books are based on memoirs and journals of Arseniev, but he made a good work to create a literature of them. And this he did exactly by focusing on friendship between him and Dersu (which indeed took place), and on unique character of the latter. And a great part of the books is a beautiful depiction of nature. The film \\\"Dersu Usala\\\" follows these initial focuses and ideas to make perfect visualization.So, please also pay some tribute to the soul and talent of Vladimir Arseniev, whose work is a masterpiece in itself, even if there were no any films based on it.There is a wiki page about this writer and some of his books were translated and can be found by non-Russian-speaking readers.\",\"100\":\"A wonderful film. It showcases the natural beauty of the Taiga and presents a contrast between the technological and the pastoral. Dersu is one with the forest. He knows its ways and its moods. The Russians scoff at his ways and his 'primitive' belief system, but eventually come to rely on him, and even love him. It is a beautiful story that takes place in an world that very few of us in the West have had a chance to see. I thought the fact that the film was set in the pre-revolutionary period gave it a peculiar sort of charm - Russia before the Great War and the Russian Revolution was innocent and even naive, the same way the Russian soldiers were innocent of the wonders and the dangers of the Taiga. One of the things I loved most about this film was the cinematography - there are long, lingering shots of the landscape, the endless steppe, the forest, the rivers, the mountains. We believe ourselves to be powerful because we have been moderately successful in our attempts to harness nature for our own uses, but the film shows us that we are deluding ourselves, that nature cannot be controlled or resisted, and the truly powerful are those, like Dersu, who co-exist in harmony with nature and learn what the wilderness teaches.\",\"101\":\"I too loved this movie when I saw in cinema, I have just bought a copy from Amazon and hope with my wide screen TV that it will give a satisfactory viewing. I was so impressed with the relationship between the two main characters and considering that this movie was made during the height of the Cold War in an area of Russia that was very restricted to visit, it is a wonder that it was ever made. I wonder if Russian censors ever got to see this film as it shows an official wavering between duty and his personal sense of right and wrong.It has subtitles but do not let that put you off watching this marvelous film that has spectacular scenery and dynamic interplay between the protagonists plus a political comment (between the lines) about Russia of the time and the world in general when first world meets third world... {:~)\",\"102\":\"Dersu Uzala is probably one of the most inspirational movies of all times. Akira Kurosawa is such a great director even we, as urban yuppies, can feel deep inside this picture with full of nature. Dersu is the primitive but also kindness model of human being. He has lived all his life in the forests of Siberia and he was so happy there with his bear and lynx friends. The scene that consists of Dersu, captain, captain's wife and his son at the same time is the one of the most influential scenes i guess. In this scene, we see all these 4 characters. Captain's wife is sewing, captain is reading a book and son is playing piano. Dersu is sitting at the right side of the room and looking down to the fireplace. We can't see his face at that time but we are sure that how sad he is and maybe he will cry soon(of course we are crying) He stands up suddenly and tells the captain that he should turn back to forests. Dersu is half-blind at that time and we all know that turning back to the forest could kill him but in spite of this we want him to turn back. Why? Because we, as urban yuppies!, wanna be happy in this big city lights and we don't. We have nowhere to run and hide but Dersu has. So we want him to go to forests and be happy. Maybe he will be killed by a tiger soon but we don't care. We have been killing by many many stupid things in our daily lives. And then. And then..This movie is one of the most powerful movies that i've ever seen.p.s: Kurdish guerilla movement Pkk, which started its acts as a socialist group in 70's to reach the idea of free Kurdistan in Turkish land and then turned a terrorist movement in 80's, had been affected of Mao Zedong. As Mao defended guerilla war in the forests, Pkk activists fought there. And many of these activists were the fan of Dersu Uzala.\",\"103\":\"This excellent film by Kurosawa is truly inspiring to me. It is beyound human feelings in the sense that it is about a clash of nature and culture, represented by Dersu, and culture, represented by the Russian officer. As I was seeing the movie, I got really carried by the actor's performance, both Maksim and Yuri Solomin, in the forest (nature) and the city (culture), the two major sets in the film.... I'm sorry if this opinion sounds a little simplistic and reducionist, but well, it's my point of view. Anyway, I think that if George Lucas really was inspired by Kurosawa's masterpiece, it is perfect, because the Star wars story is one of my favourites ever! The similarities are well noticed in Yoda, who looks a lot like Dersu; again, there is nothing wrong if one person got inspiration from Dersu Uzala....\",\"104\":\"Dersou Ouzala provides a real window on Kurosawa's mind as he went through a dark period of his career. After the box office failure of his first color film Dodes'Kaden, he tried to commit suicide. He was then at the lowest point of his career, doubting himself and his own talent. No Japanese studios were willing to trust him.But when the Soviet government contacts him to tell the story of Vladimir Arseniev, everything changes. Kurosawa portrays one of the most endearing characters in cinema. To capture beautiful landscapes is not so difficult. But when you get to tell a moving story and strong characters, your movie takes on a whole new dimension.To a certain extent, Dersu Uzala influenced The Revenant, according to Nolan himself. The correlation extends to the many problems encountered on set. The perfectionism of the two directors and the difficult conditions of the filming locations disheartened several technical teams. But while The Revenant portrayed man against nature, Dersu is a man becoming one with nature. He's always looking for symbiosis, balance. In both films, it's the power of nature that's celebrated. It's the degradation of the relationship between man and nature that denounces Kurosawa.Anti-speciesism is the ethical concept that it is immoral to exploit or harm animals just because they belong to a different species. The character of Dersu fully embodies this moto.\",\"105\":\"The film captures beautifully the clash of cultures when a supposedly sophisticated Russian surveyor befriends a Goldi hunter in Siberia. Its a story of comradeship in a harsh and lovingly photographed Siberian landscape. Ultimately tragic, as the two cultures cannot co-exist, the film is uplifting and life-affirming. Dersu believes that when he shoots at a tiger, to save himself and his Russian friend, he has upset the natural order and incurred the wrath of the forest spirit. Dersu's ensuing eyesight problems and loss of confidence seem to the Russian to be based groundlessly on superstition. So when he takes Dersu to the town to live he believes he is being helpful. His friend cannot live in the town and returns to the forest with tragic results.\",\"106\":\"I am a big fan of many Italian Neo-realist films, particularly films by De Sica, such as \\\"The Children Are Watching Us\\\" and \\\"Umberto D.\\\" and I have really enjoyed several of Indian director Satyajit Ray, such as \\\"The Big City\\\"...so I assumed I would enjoy \\\"Pather Panchali\\\". After all, Parallel Cinema (also called 'New Indian Cinema') is India's answer to this style of film which uses real folks (non actors) in realistic situations. But, as I watched, I was shocked that I did not like this film. I felt oddly disconnected from it and at odds with the film experts who see \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" as a classic. Heck, it's currently the highest rated Indian film on IMDB....yet I just didn't like it. I felt the film was very, very slow and I had a hard time focusing on the story...mostly because there really wasn't much of one. These people are very poor, generally miserable and it just felt oppressive.Just because I didn't like this film doesn't mean I won't try the other two films in Ray's 'Apu Trilogy'...but I felt disappointed by this one and I really wanted to like the movie...but didn't.By the way, I've probably reviewed at least a couple hundred Indian films....so it's not like I don't enjoy their pictures nor Ray's work. It was just this particular one...and much of it might be because there's been so much hype about this being a great film, my expectations couldn't help but be too high.\",\"107\":\"I have waited a long time to view this trilogy. I finally managed to get a copy at my local library and just viewed the first part. This is such a subtle, graphic portrayal of life in India in the Fifties (an probably today). In a small village, a family is just barely keeping going. A man, his wife, and their two children live on a subsistence level, trying not to starve. He is a man of honor and, on the word of a neighbor that his family was owed money, has given over an orchard to them. This may or may not be true. Now when his daughter steals a bit of fruit from the orchard, she is branded a thief. The man is an idealist. He is a poet and playwright who is optimistic that his work will be published or performed. Meanwhile, he works for nothing, trusting his employer to give him back wages. The family lives on handfuls of rice, also looking out for an ancient aunt. They are shunned by neighbors. The wife takes on the huge burden of the family, respecting the wishes of her husband, but knowing that he is a hopeless romantic. Apu, for whom the trilogy is named, is a little boy who manages to kee constantly on the move. He is sensitive and hard to read. His sister realizes that her peers will get married and have a better life, but she is convinced this will never happen for her (their economic state pretty much assures this.). This film is technically magnificent. Ray does things with the camera that are so on point. The black and white photography is stunning. His close-ups of the locals are masterful. We live and die with the family, hoping things will get better. The father is sort of Hindu priest who goes to another city to perform a religious ceremony for a rich man and disappears for over five months. Upon his return he is devastated by horrible news. The story of this family will now move on to another place for Part 2. It is as much about the human spirit as any film I've seen.\",\"108\":\"I sought out this movie after it received the requisite number of votes to be included in IMDb's Top 250 list, but unlike \\\"Raatchasan\\\", which was a compelling crime story and police procedural, I found this film to be somewhat underwhelming. It's not that I didn't feel bad for the impoverished family's circumstances at the center of the story, but it's resolution at the finale leaves no sense of reconciliation or hope for the viewer. It's as if the picture seeks to confirm a statement by one of Sarbojaya Ray's (Karune Bannerjee) neighbors near the finale when she states that life in their dirt poor village was like 'rotting away in one place year after year'. I felt the movie was more about daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) than about her younger brother Apu (Subir Banerjee), as described in the IMDb 'Storyline' description on this movie's title page, though the emphasis does shift when she is unfortunately taken ill and perishes. I found it inspiring the way Apu decided to insure Durga's reputation and legacy by throwing away the stolen necklace that was a focal event early in the picture. Knowing now that this film was the first in a trilogy by director Satyajit Ray, the emphasis on Apu does make more sense. However the sight of the poor family leaving their village for a new start in another area left this viewer wondering if in fact they would ever be better off.\",\"109\":\"Impoverished priest Harihar Ray (Kanu Bannerjee),dreaming of a better life for himself and his family, leaves his rural Bengal village in search of work.The realist narrative style of \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" was influenced by Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir. In 1949 Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film \\\"The River\\\" (1951). Ray, a founding member of the Calcutta Film Society (established in 1947), helped him scout for locations in the countryside. When Ray told him about his longstanding wish to film Pather Panchali, Renoir encouraged him to proceed.I absolutely love Renoir's \\\"River\\\", so I am pleased to see there is a connection between that film and this one. Unfortunately for me ,I saw a copy that was less than great. It looked pretty washed out. The 2015 Criterion version is no doubt the must-see edition, but I did not have it available to me.\",\"110\":\"Pather Panchali, or Song of the Little Road if you want, is the first part of director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed Apu Trilogy, all of which features in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically it is the 1920s in Bengal, in the village Nischindipur, and the story focuses on the impoverished Ray family. Wife and mother Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee) takes care of the home and the two children while husband and father Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) earns the meagre money from being a priest. Sarbojaya finds living in the home hard when she has to share it with very old, toothless and hunchbacked cripple sister-in-law Indirtharkun (Chunibala Devi), especially when accepting stolen fruit from her children. Sarbojaya's children, daughter Durga (Runki Bannerjee and Uma Dasgupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee) have a close relationship, and they enjoy sitting quietly under trees, chasing a candy seller, running about through the surrounding Kaash fields, and catching a glimpse of the passing trains. After many irritations with the fruit stealing and just being around, Aunt Indir is found dead in the bushes, and Harihar meanwhile is travelling abroad to find a better paying job. While he is gone the family sink further into poverty, with Sarbojaya becoming lonely, and worse, Durga develops a cold and fever from rainfall, from which she dies. When Harihar returns home he and Sarbojaya burst into tears because of Durga's death, and in the end, Apu finds a necklace that Durga denied stealing, which he throws in the pond, and they all ride away to their new destination. Also starring Tulsi Chakraborty as Schoolmaster. The performances are all very well done considering that the cast consists of non-professional actors, and the story combined with good Indian music and a marvellous director make this great drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Very good!\",\"111\":\"Apu lives with his parents and sister in a small village in Bengal. Their everyday existence is a struggle and they have to resort to all manner of means to get by.The central plot of this film was appealing: the conditions people live under and how they get by - a raw, uncompromising look at life. Yet, for me, it never seems to fulfil its potential.The main problem is that the whole movie feels like scene-setting. You expect a fair amount of time to be spend initially showing the background but then plot development should occur. There's very little plot development, resulting in the movie feeling like it is just drifting aimlessly.It also didn't help that I didn't find the main characters very engaging.Throw in an irritating soundtrack - how much sitar music do you need? - and it's a bit of a slog to get through. I even turned off the sound for a long stretch to avoid the soundtrack.\",\"112\":\"This is not a movie I'm really crazy about but I can certainly appreciate the way its made and how it turned out. It's an effective little movie. There is simple no denying that this is a greatly done film.It's one very minimalistic movie. Not only with just its sets, costumes or camera-work but also- and foremost, with its story. It's being very simplistic, which in this case is a real good things, since it lets things seem and feel real. It basically focuses entirely on one small poor family, in Bengal, India, at the beginning of the the 20th century, who are trying to survive and overcome everyday's struggles.It has lots of melodrama and other dramatic developments but yet the movie manages to keep things real and maintain a realistic approach and feeling to it all. This is all due to its minimalistic approach, that makes the movie feel very honest and real. Despite it's minimalistic approach and low budget, the movie still took a lot of time to make, due to lack of sufficient funds. Luckily after the success of this movie Satyajit Ray didn't had this problem again for the rest of it's trilogy, that got based on the novels by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. And yes, that's really actually a name.A great example of good and effective minimalistic and simplistic film-making.8\\/10http:\\/\\/bobafett1138.blogspot.com\\/\",\"113\":\"Many times, legendary films have been hyped so much by the time that modern-day audiences see them that they can't help but pale somewhat in comparison to expectations. But every so often, a film comes along that is just as great as everyone has told you it is, and \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" is one of those.This is a magnificent film about a poor Indian family struggling to make a life for themselves in their ancestral home. The father is a dreamer, a writer and philosopher who makes decision after decision that prevent his family from bettering their financial situation, while the mother is the realist, the one who feels oppressed by their stifling conditions and the one tasked with keeping the family going day after day. Satyajit Ray was influenced by the Italian Neo-Realist movement, so the point of view is fairly objective and nearly journalistic, but it does lean toward the perspectives of the family's two children, an adolescent daughter and especially a little boy, Apu. This is not a movie with big emotional scenes and manipulative histrionics. There are moments that will take your breath away, sometimes with beauty, sometimes with sadness, many times with a mix of both, but they sneak up on you. I didn't read the ending as hopeful, as some have. Rather, I read it as resigned. The family may be ok, but they may not be. In any case, they keep on going, because what other options do we have in this world?I don't know what took me so long to get around to this film.Grade: A+\",\"114\":\"It is a little known fact that India produces more films per year than any other country. The reason that most people don't know that is because their films do not generally appeal to us, and we would see them as oddities suspended in their own culture. Possibly they'd be amusing or interesting to watch, but they would probably be hard to enjoy (to demonstrate the difference in taste, Roger Ebert attended an Indian film festival a year or two ago, and when he questioned its director what American film did the best business over there, he answered that the movie _Baby's Day Out_, which is basically like one of those Popeye cartoons where Sweet-Pea wanders through construction sights blindly, except extended to 90 minutes, had theaters packed in India all throughout its run; the film bombed completely in the US). Tastes differ. Humanity does not. This is proved to the utmost in Ray's masterful _Pather Panchali_. This film has got to be the best ever made about, well, life in general. It reminded me a lot of a Chinese film, Zhang Yimou's _To Live_, which was good, but its situations finally seemed a bit contrived. _Pather Panchali_ feels as real as life itself. To be sure, it contains great moments of sadness, but, for the most part, it concentrates on the beauty of the world around us. One of the major characters is this ancient woman, maybe even in her nineties. She is hunched over, has no teeth, and has crooked eyes. But Ray makes her form beautiful. He often finds characters with exaggerated and odd features. And there is nothing more beautiful in this world than the love between members of a family, and Ray revels in this. The relationship between the brother and sister is heartstoppingly beautiful.\\nI could not say anything bad about this film. But there is one thing I would like to see: a DVD version of this film, and indeed of each of the films of the Apu Trilogy, and only Criterion could do this effectively, which is kind of disappointing, since I know a major film company already owns its rights and would probably never give them up without huge pay; a DVD version with scholarly commentary. Hindu symbology is present in a large quantity in this film, along with several Hindi ceremonies. Of course, I loved seeing this. I am not completely unfamiliar with the culture, so I was able to catch a little, but there is so much I don't know. A commentary track on a DVD would help me understand the film better, and thus love it even more.\",\"115\":\"Clearly influenced by Italian neorealism, this is the simple story of a small family living in poverty in rural Bengal. The backstory behind the film is quite impressive; it was director Satyajit Ray's first, and done with an incredibly low budget, inexperienced crew, and amateur actors. The result is often stunning. There are some truly beautiful scenes in the natural surroundings where the family live, and the cinematography is wonderful. The family members are striking as well, starting with the grandmother (Chunibala Devi), who with her withered face and stooped back, has quite an appearance. Devi portrays the character with inner fire and depth, and it was sad to read she passed away at 80 before the film was released. The little boy, Apu (Subir Banerjee) also looks out on the world he is growing up in with such beautiful eyes.Despite the film being the first in the 'Apu Trilogy', the film really centers on the mother (Karuna Banerjee), who is the bedrock of the family. She keeps it together while the husband (Kanu Banerjee) pursues idealistic dreams, often not taking their economic condition seriously enough. She deals with her neighbors, who criticize her daughter (Runki Banerjee and Uma Dasgupta) for stealing fruit, and also her parenting. She accepts her own broken dreams (\\\"I had lots of dreams too. All the things I wanted to do...\\\"), and handles the sadness which comes their way. While I appreciated the film's beauty, and the fact that it transported me into this impoverished little world, it was a little too quiet for my taste. There are some moving events and it finishes strong, but too much of it was mundane along the way. Perhaps Ray simply captures this little world perfectly, without pretense and completely realistically, which artistically is saying something, and what resonates so strongly with most critics. If that's what you're looking for, this is your film. As an alternative, I personally liked a couple of his later films better (Charulata (1964), and The Coward (1965)), which you might consider.\",\"116\":\"A marvel of originality, simplicity & social realism, Pather Panchali is an authentic & evocative portrait of life in rural India that handles its universal themes with genuine care & compassion, and the undying honesty with which it is told gives it a timeless quality & ubiquitous appeal, thus cementing it as an enduring masterpiece of Indian cinema.Written & directed by Satyajit Ray in what's his directorial debut, the film makes use of neorealist elements to add authenticity to its plot events yet at its core lies a story that will strike a chord with all demographics. Its quiet pace & random moments can alienate some but Ray's concise direction, wonderful camerawork & Ravi Shankar's mesmerising score remains gripping throughout.Also benefitting the film greatly are the strong performances from its inexperienced cast, for every actor plays their part responsibly. Through its adults, the film depicts the everyday hardships of impoverished life while through the kids' youthful eyes, it attempts to capture the small delights of their world. Though the entire cast delivers, 80-year old Chunibala Devi is singularly impressive.Overall, Pather Panchali commences Satyajit Ray's filmmaking journey on a highly promising note and is rightfully considered as a landmark of Indian cinema, for the film feels different to the established norms of our film industry even today. Finding comfort in its rambling quality which it embraces wholeheartedly, this poetic, lyrical & unfailingly human classic is by all means an essential viewing.\",\"117\":\"For some reason, I kept looking at this movie like it said, \\\"Panther Panchali\\\". That seemed to make sense, seeing as how panthers are in India. I watched these movies out of order, like I tend to do. It doesn't really matter, because this was the first in the entire series. It is of course a great movie. It can be hard for me to follow movies with subtitles. It's even harder when there's no action. This is the problem that many movies have. Since countries around the world speak different languages, we're forced to have dumber films become more popular worldwide. I'm looking at you, Transformers. The best part of this movie is probably the down to earth nature. Everything is as realistic as it can be and I just love looking at cats.The basic plot is that Apu's father goes off to try to make money. We get a ton of little things going on. The aunt dies, his sister is accused of stealing beads, and many others. As a slice of life story, you can expect a lot of little things to go on. It seems like we rarely see depictions of poor families. It's from a different culture, but we can still relate and feel sorry for everybody. ****\",\"118\":\"\\\"Pather Panchali\\\" is a Drama movie in which we watch a man trying to provide a better life to his family and seeking a better work outside of their village. A lot change upon his leaving and he has to deal with that before it's too late.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and contained some very realistic scenes that presented in a very clear way. The direction which was made by Satyajit Ray was very good and he presented very well his main characters and the life they had, the difficulties and the struggle of every day life. The interpretations of Subir Banerjee who played as Apu Ray, Uma Das Gupta who played as Durga and Karuna Bannerjee who played as Sarbojaya Ray were very good and their combination created this amazing movie. In conclusion, I have to say that \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" is an interesting drama movie that presents very well some ugly truths about society and it's very realistic so, I recommend you to watch it.\",\"119\":\"Watching the film, Pather Panchali (Song of the Little Road) directed by Satyajit Ray, you would have thought that Ray was a season veteran director, but in truth, it's his debut work about the life of a family in Bengal living in poverty. Based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, when Ray started this film, I think Ray had literally never held a movie camera. I understand that Italian neo-realist films had a big influence on him; all to the better. There are a number of key scenes shot in the film that beholds the beauty and emotional depth in itself. The film never had a complete script; it was made from Ray's drawings and notes. Ray tried to extract and build a simple theme out of the apparently random sequences of significants. Some notable shifts from the novel in the script include the death scenes of key characters, one which occurs quite early in the novel in a village shrine at the presence of some adult members of the family; in the film that key character dies in the open in the presence of the family children, Apu and Durga. The scene of Apu and Durga running to catch a glimpse of the train is not there in the novel, neither child manages to see the train there, although they made an attempt. That scene alone is well played. Such a beautiful scene. I love the sounds of the wind and the hum of the electricity, and the slow, fading edits. It captures perfectly the landscape and the young child's curiosity. The train shows the changes happening in India, and we know the children will grow into a world that is different to their parents. They are left gazing at a thin veil of smoke as the sound of the wind returns. It is very moving. Camera work as usual in Satyajit Ray's film is always brilliant as it has used lot of drifting tracking shot. There almost cosmic emotional power in some other scenes, such as the sunset with Apu and that of the monsoon. The scene from when the snake creeps into an abandoned 'house of sorrows' to their stunned faces on the ox cart was a unforgettable Ravi Shankar theme. I think it foreshadows death. Apu & sister Durga share an intimate bond, they exploring their little world and sharing secrets are the most remarkable aspect of this film. The language might be foreign to me but the emotions were completely native. The film took three years to complete the shooting, and it's was just lucky it got finished with little to no money to product. Pather Panchali was followed by two films that continued the tale of Apu's life 'Aparajito' (The Unvanquished) in 1956 & Apur Sansar (The World of Apu) in 1959. The only faults I can find in this film is that it's insanely depressing. The movie has a lot of death, and nothing really get any better for the family as the film goes on. There is no happy ever after, as this isn't Slumdog Millionaire. The movie is hard to find, and if found, it's rarely in English subtitles and the video transfer is horrible, the sound transfer only marginally better. Another factor is the disconnection by scene to scene, and gives an all-inclusive quality to the film; yet it is also distracting and contributes to the film's great weakness: its general diffuseness, its inability to command sustained attention as the film pace is slow. For Pather Panchali, remarkable as it may be, is something of a chore to sit through. It's run time is 122 mins, and there are long periods of time of nothing going on. One can stare in dull amaze for only so long looking at nature. The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature. The second half of the film, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical. There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action. Film is still better than 2 most of today's loud, flashy torture bollywood movies. This film is true art.\",\"120\":\"Satyajit Ray's debut! A masterpiece. Why? Because it makes you cry. It will make you pull your emotions out. It will do what no other film can do: introspect!Pather Panchali depicts the life and times of a poverty-stricken family, the way the lead lady copes with her life, her kin and her children. The fascination of the kids to see the train pass by, the young girl's eagerness to get married as her friends start settling with their spouses, the little boy's (Apu's) innocent activities will all make you think, think and think. This is not just cinema, this is a wonderful epitome on which we all must try to rely as we continue to lead our lived without meaning. Pather Panchali is EPIC!If you are looking for serious cinema or not, you gotta watch this before you die!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESLanguage: No Sex: No Mouth-Kiss: No Violence: No Nudity: Women do not wear upper underthings.\",\"121\":\"Part one of Satyajit Ray's Apu Trilogy which concludes with Aparajito and Apur Sansar, Pather Panchali (literally translated as 'Song Of The Little Road') is a Bengali masterpiece and the film that introduced the master filmmaker to the world. Made on a shoestring budget, it focuses on the struggles of a poverty-stricken Bengali family seen through the eyes of their smallest child Apu (played by Subir Bannerjee). The film came about when Ray was illustrating a new edition of Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's novel, and the idea of writing a film script occurred to him as he admired the lyrical writing and honest depiction of a struggling family. Ray assisted Jean Renoir as he shot his film The River and suggested the idea to him, to which Renoir reacted with enthusiastic encouragement.The film follows the Ray family as they go about their day-to-day lives in a small, rural village in Bengal. The mother Sarbujaya (Karuna Bannerjee) carries the weight of the burden, seemingly forever cleaning and working and living off the land. The father Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee) helps out doing odd jobs and mostly working away, chasing back payments he has not received from his landlord boss. Durga (Uma Das Gupta) is the teenage daughter who seems to have a weakness for petty theft and has something of a reputation in the village. The grandmother Indir (Chunibala Devi) spends her time stealing food from her daughter and wandering the village. Watching over everything is the most recent arrival Apu, who sees everything with a wide-eyed innocence and remains generally silent throughout the film. By the way, the mother, father and Apu are all played by actors with the surname Bannerjee, although they are not related.One of Ray's key influences to filmmaking are the great films of Italian neo-realism, such as Vittorio De Sica's masterpiece The Bicycle Thieves and Roberto Rossellini's Rome, Open City. It is evident here, as the film has the same visual poetry and social realism, as well as the ability to transport the viewer into a world that they most likely have never, and will never, experience first hand. It is a fascinating insight into how some people of Bengal had to live during this period, and their social attitudes. When Durga is accused of stealing a necklace from one the village children, the women of the village form a kind of posse to confront her mother, accusing her of being unable to raise her children correctly. The family have conflicting attitudes to the rogue- ish grandmother who spends her time almost begging for clothing to keep her warm; the mother looks down on her as a leech, yet the children, especially Durga, look upon her as a lovable character, and someone they can always seek comfort in.It's a film dominated by outstanding performances. Devi was discovered by Ray living in a brothel, having previously starred in two films in her heyday. She is lovable and tragic, and her performance here would become her swansong, at the age of 80. Tragically she died of influenza before the film was released but she will be immortalised for her portrayal here. Karuna Bannerjee is also a standout, switching from sadness to joy to tragedy with effortless conviction, especially during the third act of the film where the family struggles to hold out during monsoon season, where her home risks being ripped apart by the torrential rain and wind. The biggest star of the show, however, is Ray himself, creating a multi-layered film of visual poetry and gorgeous cinematography, with very little funding for his project. He would go on to be one of world cinema's most creatively successful and critically acclaimed directors, making over 30 features in a 35-year career. At the start of filming, Ray had never directed anything in his life, the camera had never shot a film, and the majority of the actors has never acted in front of the camera. Absolutely outstanding stuff, and deserves it's place amongst the world's greatest films.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com\",\"122\":\"Pather Panchali (1955) :A Classic that defined Parallel Cinema but why so special? It can be argued. Satyajit Ray has been known as the Greatest Filmmaker ever born on Indian Soil and so he has legacy and films that prove it authentically. When did he debuted was the question many of us had, here is the answer. It's Pather Panchali, the debut of Legendary Filmmaker. In early 50s Bollywood Cinema thought about Social realism seriously and that resulted into so many socially important films. From Commercial blockbusters to Realistic art films, Bollywood begun running fast on the road of rich content cinema and it would be difficult to know where did it all begin? I see many people calling Pather Panchali as the pioneer of Parallel Cinema that broke Socially Realistic theme but didn't we have a Classic like Do Bigha Zameen before? This arguments can never end if one really want to get into it so let it be. Pather Panchali is a tale of poverty that comes through social realism and defines Art Cinema mode. I won't say it's a grest story and all, but for me more than story it's about cinema style, filmmaking techniques, artistic nuances and realistic carnation of disturbing tale. The background score tells us how the scene is making sense and what mood it has, that's unbelievable. Can you believe it? A background score is used for the exploration of mood and turning situations in the film that too in mid 50s. While supporting this, the Cinematography does something similar unbelievable stuff to achive some great heights in creative techniques. Such things can't be described in words because these had to be experienced and recognised. Of course because everyone has a different brain, everybody will understand it in different ways. I didn't mind the slow pace as far as it was maki sense and showing quality but what's so Outstanding in that needs to be explained. Overall, A Classic Piece of Realistic Cinema but why so special is still an arguable point.RATING - 8\\/10*By - #samthebestest\",\"123\":\"... but definitely not black and white.

And it's really watchable compared with the singing Bollywood junk. I read that the crew had no previous experience, but I say you can have a certain feeling of sincerity you simply don't get with the polished junk produced in Europe and States in the last twenty years. Maybe it's a delusion, maybe it's wishful thinking, maybe it's really there, that soul of the light impression. Sadly, it's extremely hard to digest. For a local, or anybody familiar with the culture and life, things might be more than obvious with the flowers or the interactions based on outer appearance. For me it was a search in the dark. Does the little girl praying to the showered flower means she {the character} is improvising hoping for the better? Or is it a ready-made formula of good luck? Does she look forward for a marriage because her friend and neighbor did it? Does she look forward as a way to help her mother and brother ease on spending thinking one less mouth to feed? Does she want to marry well to escape the poverty? By her actions it seems less plausible. But maybe she wants to have someone to help her family. Or something else. As I have written - for a local it must be quite clear. If not from the scene itself, maybe from the context. For me it just raised questions.

It's almost an insult they dare to compare this to Tarkovsky's films.\",\"126\":\"Helluva directorial debut, huh? Perhaps not \\\"Citizen Kane\\\", but pretty darn close, this autobiographical film from Satyajit Ray, the first of a trilogy, is many things...a bildungsroman, an intense family drama, a harshly lyrical picture of rural life...but for me what it most vividly and powerfully evokes is the awfulness of poverty, the sheer misery of not having enough; enough money, treats (forget luxuries), clothes, sanitation, decent medical care, education, and, perhaps most crucially for someone as naturally curious about life as is Apu, exposure to the world outside that stultifying village in which he must spend his youth, with only a passing glimpse at a train to serve as an escape valve. And Ray gives us this bitter pill without sugar coating, a la Hollywood depictions of poverty (No charming Bowery Boys here). Yes, there are occasional moments of happiness but they are fleeting, while misery, in the shape of death and hopelessness, can always be counted on swiftly to return. And the film's last shot, with the reduced family being forced to flee out of economic necessity, in an ox cart, to the city, as they stare hollowly into the future, is as utterly bleak an ending as you will find. Not much more to add except that Karuna Banarjee ,who portrayed the mother, by far the most complex member of the family, with her combination of love, hard heartedness, hopefulness and resentment, should have won the Oscar given to Grace Kelly for \\\"The Country Girl\\\", the kind of Hollywood hokum for which this film is the perfect antidote, and that people who find this film \\\"slow\\\" should be consigned to an eternity of watching \\\"Smokey And The Bandit\\\". Give it an A.\",\"127\":\"Watching movies about people suffering in impoverished areas of the world is not exactly a pleasant experience. It can be informative, because we learn a bit about how their day-to-day lives look, but it's not what I would call enjoyable. Pather Panchali takes us through a handful of years in the life of an Indian family that is struggling to provide food and shelter for their children. It is a big slice-of-life drama that doesn't exactly follow a narrative, but hits on some of the highlights (or should I say lowlights) of their menial existence. Watching the film reminded me of when missionaries visit my church and show a video. While seeing their simple lives in these remote parts of the world, it does give me a strong appreciation for all I have, and it also makes me extremely grateful that I don't have to spend time in places like that. However, Pather Panchali takes me right there and keeps me in that place for more than two hours.Pather Panchali is clearly an accurate reflection of life for people in these desperate parts of the world, but that makes it somewhat unpleasant for me to watch for long. I don't find any pleasure in seeing people suffer, and the more the movie made the characters likeable, the more I hated to watch them struggle. The other thing that didn't work for me in Pather Panchali are the slow silent moments. There are times when the film halts any dialogue, and not much at all happens as we stare at a person walking or a breeze blowing through the trees. I hate to say it, but for a film that feels so personal and authentic, I was bored a lot. Then when things started happening again it was more disappointment or agony for our main characters. I can see how others might embrace Pather Panchali because there is nothing inherently bad in the way the film is made, and it feels like it could be documentary footage, but it was fairly tough for me to watch.\",\"128\":\"A real masterpiece indeed in every aspect: atmosphere, interpretation, dramatic stoutness of the plot and a remarkable gallery of authentic characters.

The father decides to leave for the city to get a better job. Daily life is shown in a very realistic detailed way. Everything is really dramatic and tragedy ends by falling upon the rest of the family, pushing the man who had come back meanwhile to leave the village and head for the city with his family. This is one of those movies you must decidedly not to miss.\",\"129\":\"Somewhere between the Oriental placidity of a great Yasujiro Ozu film and the harsh reality of a great Vittorio De Sica film lies the world of Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali, the first of his Apu Trilogy of films. And in case there was any doubt, that place is a very, very good one for any filmmaker to be, for the two aforementioned filmmakers were masters of their own sorts of films, and- if this one, and first, film of Ray's is an indication, the same plaudits can be ascribed to Ray, a former advertising firm's employee who struck out on his own to raise Indian cinema from the melodramatic doldrums it had been in since its creation.This almost two hour long black and white film, made in 1955, was not only Ray's debut in the medium, but the first 'serious' film in Indian history- at least that made by an Indian. It is no surprise that Ray, a Bengali, made his film in his part of India- funded by the provincial government of West Bengal, away from the more commercial films of what would later be called Bollywood. The film's English subtitle is Song Of The Little Road, but this is a bit of a nonsequitur since the film is based on a novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay, and the only road with any prominence in the film is a recurring hagiography of a local set of railroad tracks. Some websites claim that the title connotes the subtitle, and that Pather, in Bengali, means of a path, and Panchali means a kind of Bengal song; however, other sites and critics dispute this claim. The tale is set in the early 20th Century, although the film never specifies a date- at least not in the white English subtitles of the Artificial Eye DVD The Apu Trilogy three pack, which includes the other two films, as well: Aparajito and The World Of Apu.Like the Italian Neo-Realist films of De Sica, Ray relied on an excellent script (adapted by Ray, from the novel) and amateur actors, for the most part, to pull the film off. A low budget made 'big' scenes an impossibility, but Ray shows off, in this film, some nice touches with the camera that cost nothing but a few minutes of cogitation. These skills all led to international praise of the film in many quarters, and a special award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.The plot of the tale is rather simple, and easily conveyed, but this film is a great example of how merely recapitulating or summing up a plot utterly does an injustice to the deeper and greater story....Pather Panchali is a truly great film; it is not only a classic of its native land, but of the very art form of film. And, as mentioned, it not only derives its power from Italian Neo-Realism, but also from the diurnal do of Yasujiro Ozu's films. Ozu is another filmmaker who has been criticized as dull and tedious, but both men are keen observers of their fictive worlds. In those realms the flicker of an eyebrow can have greater consequence than an army brigade's assault on an enemy. Yet, to the viewer not yet weaned off of the Lowest Common Denominator, such moments are not even noticed. I only wish that Satyajit Ray, who died in 1992, was still around to know that his film was yet influencing more people in the positive way all great art does, but realize, as he surely did, that he need not be, for great art always and eventually fills out the places the human body gives way to. In watching Pather Panchali, one gets a sense of Satyajit Ray, as he was. Go know him.\",\"130\":\"A poor family in rural Bengal, India in the 1920s deals with life's struggles but the two children, Durga and Apu, manage to find joy in the simplest things.Director Satyajit Ray keeps a very smooth and gentle flow moving in this film. Even the smallest of situations can be made to be eventful. His camera helps us to experience the beauty of such things as a wind blowing against a field or lifting lily pads in a river. The mood is greatly aided by the sweet musical score by Ravi Shankar especially when the sitar is played.As the film is mostly seen through the eyes of the older girl and her younger brother, the audience can feel many emotional memories of childhood including that emotional love\\/hate ambivalence that is shared among siblings, cousins, and neighbours. This emotional gut feeling also occurs when Durga and Apu have wants that exceed their family's means but they also have a sense of wonder in things adults would either take for granted or are too busy to experience.While the film might seem simple through most of its duration, this technique is used to build up for a final fifteen minutes that is so shocking and gripping, it would move even the most still of hearts. The impact is felt well after the film's conclusion. One powerful technique Ray uses is to have the camera on the faces of two people simultaneously where one is aware of the shocking event while the other is blissfully ignorant.The rating below reflects my feelings after a fourth viewing but, keep in mind, it was a perfect four-star rating the first three times I saw Pather Panchali.

Most of the greatest scenes from this movie was analysed to study purpose, but, I haven't seen the whole movie yet. It's today that I have seen the whole movie.

This film put me under great depression, and the hangover is going to be there for a long time, for sure.Selling properties, borrowing and adjusting funds, a man working in the advertisement field has a passion to film making. He never had any previous experience, his cameraman had zero experience in film making, and the actors were randomly chosen from the surrounds, and here emerges the magician, the one only Ray, to the international attention with his debut, low budget movie. Through the struggles and delays, it took over 3 years to complete the movie, the final hands were stretched from the Goverment of West Bengal. When, acclaimed director John Huston saw the film, the fate of Indian cinema changes for over. Ray and his films always had international attention thereafter. No film student can complete his studies without analyzing the work of Ray, especially Pather Panchali.More than a movie, it takes you to the life of a remote Indian village, and the life of very common people. Appu and Durga seems to be like very familiar friend, or a nostalgic feeling of my own childhood somewhere.

Ironically, I must confess that I had never seen Pather Panchali completely. The several times I started to watch the film, seemingly something arose during those few times and I never got very far into it. However, now in my senescent years, I finally got around to seeing it after realizing that I never had taken the time to see it. Having read about the trilogy and about Satyajit Ray, I look back and wonder why of all the classics I've seen, I'd overlooked these works of Ray. Maybe it was the trauma I experienced 50 years ago at UC Berkeley while taking a year of Sanskrit but I doubt it. I'll only say now I must have been saving it for a treat during my later years. And, what a treat! The film has a languid quality and moves slowly, listfully. The imagery is diffused due to in part the quality of the film but the eye of the camera misses nothing from shots of nature to a kitten stumbling and licking itself, to the old Auntie brushing away flies from her food. The starkness of their poverty does not affect the world of a little boy as it does his frustrated mother and sister. His father, a kind-hearted dreamer, seems resigned to his lot and is willing to take less to keep his sense of life and desire in balance. All of this life trajectory is classic Indian and Ray shows us to us through the camera's eye in a way that is moving, joyous and profound. This is their world and Ray lets us see it through their eyes. Akira Kurasawa called Ray a genius and we guess we could say, it took one to know one.\",\"135\":\"'Panchali' has been acclaimed for its Renoir-like naturalism, but the tale it tells is as close to Gothic as  'Toni'.  The noble family in decline, the crumbling family house, the steady, overpowering incremence of nature onto civilisation, the generational conflict where the hopes of youth are tainted with decadence of the past, the climactic storm scene that brings everything to a head.  These are all staples of the Gothic story, and although the world of the film blazes in an intolerable sun, the film itself is shrouded in ominous, often impenetrable shadows (although, admittedly, the print I saw was very saturated).  But this is not a study of an old, fat, corrupt, European country hobbling on its last legs, the usual subject of classic Gothic, but a newly emergent nation less than a decade old.  Is the film, like most Gothic fiction, an allegory for the nation?  Ray doesn't make hammering political points - there are references to a neighbouring landlord who probably conned the gullible family of land; there is the bizarre and comic sight of impoverished elders in tatty British uniforms playing a discordant brass version of 'It's a long way to Tipperary'.  The hideous old crone for whom Durga steals fruit, and whose presence exasperates her mother, is called India - it is tempting to see her age, her expulsion, her constant need for water, her enlisting the young in dangerous schemes to feed her, her abandonment, her lonely death by a stream, as some kind of allegorical reading, but of what?  Certainly, throughout, Ray is constantly pushing his realism further than mere observation, so that scenes that seem simply to record a way of life are pregnant with hidden meanings.  For instance, the harrowing depiction of poverty is frequently disrupted by spectacle and play, from the children's games to the theatrical melodramas that enrapture Apu.  Even Ray's style continually, disarmingly changes registers, alternating calm, distant compositions with urgent sequences broken up by strange angles, choppy editing, heightened music and sound.  The film's structure seems to embody this duality between realism and the figurative.  The first half is nearer to social realism, setting out the social hierarchies, introducing characters and their social or family role, defining them against other people, their home and nature.  It is full of rich characterisation, even comedy, and full of set-pieces that reveal character and society.  The second half, however, becomes more abstract, even mystical.  There is less reliance on words as characters go through strange rites where the emphasis is on observation or action.  The nature that had been encroaching on civilisation spills over in these sequences, with stunning montages that recall Dovzhenko.  The whole film feels slower, more meaningful and monumental (and sometimes duller).  My favourite sequences are in this half, the discovery of the road and railway, the possibility of another life; the silent roaming through a beautiful, dwarfing landscape that recalls the mysticism of the Archers' 'A Canterbury Tale'.  This clash between nature and the home is expressed in the immediate terms of children growing up, their senses (and sensuality) awakening, seeing clearly the flaws of much-vaunted tradition.  The film is very acute about gender, to the point of schematism; the dependence of the culture on servile, worn-down women, the charming, irresponsibility of men, the doom of any girl who might seek independence (figures who quickly (or maybe always were) types).  The fate of Durga, after her sprightly impishness at the beginning is heartbreaking.  The film is also a sophisticated analysis of modes of representation and the nature of cinema, of looking, linked to social control - Apu's entrance, where, after a lengthy build-up, he returns the observing eye, is as shocking and exhilarating as 'Un Chien Andoulu'.\",\"136\":\"For twenty whole years of my life I lived in ignorance without having seen the sun or the moon but today I have finally seen the Ray and I feel holy and blessed now. Akira Kurusawa, the man behind Japanese classics like Rashomon and Ran rightly said years ago that living in a world without having seen a Satyajit Ray film is similar to living without having seen the sun or moon; almost every film I've watched feels effete after living in Ray's world. It is a transcending experience watching the late Bengali director's debut effort Pather Panchali, one that deeply impacts the very core of your soul in a way that makes you feel afterwards as though you've lived two lives \\u2013 one before having watched Pather Panchali and one after. It achieves the remarkable feat of invoking your senses to a higher state of consciousness; the experience watching Pather Panchali is similar to reading Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace or some of William Blake's or Emily Dickinson's finest achievements, or watching Meryl Streep's iconic turn as Sophie Zawistowski in Sophie's Choice. The feeling is so powerful that it took me more than an hour to get back to my original state; the hardest part for me was to return the DVD to the movie rental store because I knew the true worth of what I was holding. May god bless the guy who recognized Pather Panchali's worth years ago and preserved the original prints so the world today can have a chance to be transported to the precious little magical world of Apu, the film's protagonist. This little world is black and white to the outer eye, but the film is so richly filmed and composed that it colors our mind with the most exquisite palette. The opening credits, which wouldn't be understood by anyone who can't read Bengali, still captures the spirit of Pather Panchali though Ravi Shankar's playful, whimsical and yearning tabla beats and sitar strums; only Michael Danna could hypnotize us in 2012's Life of Pi with a similarly evocative score. Ray's world opens not with Apu or his sister Durga but with the film's most antagonistic character, the rancorous neighbor of Apu's family who's worshipping the tulsi plant early in the morning. Satyajit follows her as she notices Durga, the still-unborn Apu's sister, stealing fruits from her courtyard. Durga runs along the woods to her shanty home and hands the fruits to her senescent grandaunt Indir Thakrun after keeping milk for her three little cats. Ray then cuts back to the nagging neighbor who is berating Durga and cursing her family for raising a thief; in an excellently composed sequence, Ray is able to seamlessly capture her, the lady listening in the next house balcony listening to her and Durga's pregnant mother Sarbajaya and her empathic friend collecting water from the well behind the neighbor's house, well within earshot of the woman's bitter rant. Sarbajaya confronts her daughter for stealing fruits and then berates Indir Thakrun for encouraging Durga's bad behavior. Indir Thakrun leaves the house temporarily, frustrated by Sarbajaya's nagging, but returns soon as Sarbajaya gives birth to Apu. A couple of dissolves then takes us some years ahead and we see Apu now as an innocent school-going kid who's most fond of his sister Durga. His family is barely able to fulfill their basic needs, with Apu's soft- mannered father Harihar Roy being too lax about asking his dues from his employer; he is neither able to make much as a playwright. This situation makes it especially tough for Sarbajaya to manage the household needs as she herself doesn't like begging others for monetary or any other help; she therefore is all the more harsh on Indir Thakrun, who sometimes like Durga is wont to taking food items from Sarbajaya's kitchen without permission. There are two sequences at different points in the film which include Harihar and Sarbajaya; both retain the same posture in the sequences but while in the first sequence, Harihar gives a more optimistic image to Sarbajaya to pacify her, in the second he sounds less enthusiastic while Sarbajaya looks more worried for their future. Apu is still too young to be affected by the family problems and we only see him enjoying his childhood days with Durga and his friends. Durga is extremely supportive of everybody including her mother, who reacts violently towards Durga when same neighbor in the beginning accuses Durga of stealing her daughter's beaded necklace. The family's problems persist after Harihar travels to nearby city to find work and tragedies strike one after the other; the family's only hope, as told by Harihar in his letters to Sarbajaya after leaving, is to leave everything to God's Grace keeping in mind that everything happens for the better. To Satyajit Ray, every image and every sound, both on-screen and off- screen matter. It's his craftsmanship as a movie visionary that segues the film so well that you are bemused to hear that it's his debut film. I've read one of his books, a compilation of his essays and theories on film, and he mentions how his inexperienced crew hadn't even operated a camera before filming Pather Panchali and so the first half was a little choppy in editing. I don't have any clue what he's talking here because to my eyes, every image was seamlessly stitched together. To me he didn't capture images but rather created images on film; it's difficult to express just how wonderfully he captures Sarbajaya's gradual breakdown in the film without using superlatives. And his genius picture is complemented by Ravi Shankar's background score, which includes sound of bells that ring during a cheerful sequence with a candy man and also during some of the haunting moments; it reminded me of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant poem The Bells. Pather Panchali is scintillating, and Satyajit is the Ray of Light.\",\"137\":\"Pather Panchali requires patience and thoughtful engagement with its characters, but it rewards you for it. It's a slow moving slice of life film about an Indian family, particularly a mother and daughter. I think De Sica would be proud of this one, as it does feel extremely similar stylistically to Bicycle Thieves. Few real events happen in the film - instead, we just spend time with the characters as they struggle to get by and enjoy the small things in life. In this way, it reminded me of a wonderful recent slice of life movie: The Florida Project. In both, we understand the parental struggle to balance emotional, financial, and parenting stability for their kids, and we also get many scenes shot from the children's perspective, where these wonderful kids living in extreme poverty see simple things in the world with utter awe. The bond between Apu and Durga was very pleasant, and the way all the characters reacted to the ending was realistic and heartbreaking. One small directorial choice I loved was the mirroring of how Durga woke Apu up at the beginning and how she found Auntie dead - shaking them while there was a blanket over them, with the music in the early scene hinting at darkness. There's a lot to get out of this one thematically in regards to family, tradition, and what defines a community, but you have to be ready for the slow, contemplative pace.\",\"138\":\"I've been asked what my favorite film of all time is. It's a silly question, and the answer might have changed over the years. But I am certain now. It is \\\"Pather Panchali,\\\" completed by Satyajit Ray in 1955. Strange that I would settle on an Indian film, since I have specialized all my life in Italian movies and think I know a good deal about them. But no, \\\"Pather Panchali,\\\" spoken in Bengali and made on a budget that couldn't buy a coffee break on a major production anywhere today, is my favorite film.Why? Oh, goodness...because of its poetry, its humanity, its timeless and haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, its powerful portrayal of a family and a culture. I first saw it when I was a senior in high school. I went to the Avon in Providence, where it played for a week in 1959. Overwhelmed, I went three or four times that week. I told people about it but nobody seemed interested. And it's futile even now to promote this film among folks who only respond to graphic action, moronic one-liner comedies, thundering vacuous soundtracks, the vapid melodrama of snakes on planes. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" means \\\"Song of the Road,\\\" and was the first film by its director, made as a total labor of love. He began in 1952 in 16mm, then got financing from the Bengal government to complete the work in 35mm. It took four years, and was shown to great acclaim at Cannes, where it won one of the top awards. It was a radical departure from Indian film convention which has characters breaking out into song every ten minutes, regardless of the story.The movie was the first of a trilogy Ray completed in a few years. \\\"The Apu Trilogy\\\" is about the life of an idealistic hero. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" deals with the youth of Apu and his impulsive sister Durga, and the travails of his Brahmin priest father and his worrying mother in the midst of crushing poverty. The second and third parts are \\\"Aparajito\\\" and \\\"The World of Apu.\\\" All these classics are highly acclaimed masterpieces and very much liked by discriminating audiences.\\\"Pather Panchali\\\" turns everyday childhood occurrences into wondrous events, whether it is brother and sister crossing the fields filled with white feathery rushes to see a train in the distance, a pursuit of the candy man, a Hindu feast, the wonders of the natural world, an ancient aunt telling bedtime stories to children. Death interrupts the family twice, taking away young Durga too. The scene in which the long-absent father returns to learn of the death of his daughter is a lacerating wail from the beyond. Apu's concealing forever the suddenly-learned truth of a secret theft by his sister is a moment, once seen, can never be forgotten. In sadness, mother, father, young son move away. The film ends.Musician-composer Ravi Shankar did the beautiful score. He was a virtual unknown at the time, but I traced down recordings of his music (decades before his legendary Woodstock appearance!) and still listen to them. Ray was influenced by the Italian neo-realists, particularly De Sica in \\\"The Bicycle Thief,\\\" which he said bowled him over.In the mid-90s the films of Ray were restored and reissued to great acclaim, and retrospectives took place everywhere. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" and the rest of the \\\"Apu Trilogy\\\" are available on video or DVD at libraries and retailers and form the nucleus of any collection of world cinema. It is a shining work of art.\",\"139\":\"Splendidly photographed Indian slice of life that feels at once real and poetic. My favorite scenes were those of the children finding the train; and the pathetic old aunt lovingly looking at a guava. That old lady makes Garbo uninteresting.\",\"140\":\"Pather Panchali is full of poetic depictions of humans in all their pettiness, silliness, honor, and beauty. We \\\"live\\\" with a typical family over the years, as they struggle, love, fight, laugh, cry, and die. Shot beautifully in black and white, the moments are shown in lingering, thoughtful ways, whether as direct observations or symbols. This is a slice of life film but with a monumentality hidden within the smallest of gestures. You must be in no rush. This is a very patient film with no big punch lines or actions sequences. Allow yourself to join these people, and take some of their experiences home with you. This is part one of a trilogy, often called the \\\"Apu Trilogy\\\". They are all directed by Satyajit Ray.\",\"141\":\"Notwithstanding the emphasis given to the character Apu in the title of \\\"The Apu Trilogy,\\\" this first movie of that trilogy really seems to be about his mother, Sarbojaya Ray, who is so beset by grinding poverty that she has a hard time being nice to her family. Her elderly cousin, Indir, whom the family calls \\\"Auntie,\\\" is a poor old woman who can barely see or walk, and Sarbojaya treats her miserably, eventually driving her away and forcing her to die alone in the woods. The woman's husband, Harihar Ray, comes across as a slacker and a dreamer (he thinks he can make money by writing plays), but maybe he is just a victim of the caste system. Her daughter, Durga, is a thief, but she is likable. Finally, there is Apu, who will play a larger role in the sequels. After his sister dies, Apu destroys something she stole so no one will know, even though everyone really knows anyway. While the husband is away for months without sending money, a storm hits and destroys their house, because he never got around to making the needed repairs. This forces them to move to the city, where we doubt that things will get any better.\",\"142\":\"'Pather Panchali', the first one in Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy', is a cinematic masterpiece, and the best one in the trilogy. The story, the characters, the situations, everything in this movie overflows with such excruciating reality and brilliance. It well-deservedly won the 'Best Human Document Award' at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival.No matter how old and slow the movie is, it's captivating and extremely absorbing from the very beginning, and shows the heights a film, at its best, is capable of achieving. It stands out because of its poetry, its humanity, its haunting lyric beauty, its imagery, and its remarkable portrayal of a family and a culture.Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's impressive screenplay, along with Satyajit Ray's exceptional direction, portrayed through powerful performances by every actor in the movie, makes it the film that it is.Ray's direction is top-notch and one-of-a-kind. The characters, their hopes and dreams, their behaviour and relationships - everything is shown with such brutal realism, relatability and poignancy. I was really able to empathize, and feel the angst and pain of the characters. And if this is not enough, imagine this was Ray's debut movie, and made on a budget that wouldn't buy a five-star meal these days! The movie proves why Satyajit Ray is referred to as the Grand Master of World Cinema.This first part in the trilogy takes you through the starting years of Apu's childhood when he was living in his ancestral home in Bengal, with his parents and sister. The dual themes of progress and loss form the core of this film, as well as the whole trilogy.On a personal note, this is the best film I've ever seen which explores childhood so stunningly. The movie's places, characters and every other thing reminded me of something from my childhood; it was nostalgic and heart-wrenchingly beautiful. There are so many scenes of the siblings which remind wondrous events from one's childhood: the pursuit of a sweet-seller, running across white fields to catch a glimpse of a moving train, a simple picnic among friends in the forest, playfully getting wet in rain, and hiding some evidence so that the other sibling doesn't into trouble.Even the range of intriguing characters in the film is vast; the hardworking but seldom-present father, the overburdened mother, the innocent siblings exploring the world around them, the always complaining or blaming neighbour\\/landlord, and the old and usually silent old lady in the neighbourhood who's always in her own world. Even at this age, the Trilogy is considered to be one of the most important and brilliant pieces of Cinematic History. Legendary Japanese Filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once aptly said: \\\"Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.\\\"\",\"143\":\"Artfully staged, photographed, scored and edited, a slice of life in an Indian village reveals poor and bored natives. Perhaps more entertaining for the audience: children steal fruit that falls from a neighbor's tree followed by petty squabbles and complaints. Children race through fields and forest, animals loll in the afternoon sun, some people die. For others, life goes on. There is sadness in the village.\",\"144\":\"The film is a true example of presenting the humanity. The film is about a poor Bengali family who is struggling to make their ends meet. Their wishes are very simple and true to the situation. The two children are amazing. First Durga mesmerizes you with her looks and her running styles and then comes Apu, whose eyes say everything.The one who steals the show is the mother of children. Circles around her eyes always say a lot more than she wants to represent. Their father also performs the role very nicely. I was very happy to see the acting. The soundtrack although not too much engaging, at times gives a strange nice feeling. The story is no doubt good but what makes this film more fascinating than it might have been in the book is the ability of a great maestro (Satyajit Ray) to represent them with so profound emotion. The outcome after the difficulties he had faced during the making is truly a treat to watch. MESSAGE: \\\"Life goes on.\\\"VERDICT: \\\"A must watch for all cine lovers.\\\"\",\"145\":\"Beautiful beyond words.I don't think my review is short. It is more than enough I guess.\",\"146\":\"Authentic account of the life of a poor, rural Indian family's life and hardships during a few year's time. Universal in theme but doesn't really get gripping until the final 15 min's during a memorable rain storm. Feels almost like a student project in its utter simplicity, technical limitations and primitive montage storytelling... which at times makes it a bit hard to follow in exactly what's going on (some bits are just frame filling and have no cause-and-effect whatsoever). I read after watching it that the father is a priest, and that it's supposed to be set in the early 1900's... gee - good to know, because the movie itself certainly doesn't tell me so! But most of the time it's just unclear if we have a main character: The mother? The daughter? No, apparently (again, after reading more about it afterward) it's supposed to be Apu, the son - which is weird since he honestly doesn't get more attention - OR personal character development than anyone else!I badly want to be more generous (like when you have to be nice about commenting a small kid's poor, ugly doodle drawings) because of its earnestness and alleged historical influence\\/importance to Indian cinema. But I can't - because it's simply not good enough. It's more an exotic rarity\\/half-documentary than being a particularly good movie. Do I feel like watching the sequels? Not much.4\\/10 from Ozjeppe.\",\"147\":\"POSSIBLE SPOILERS:\\\"Pather Panchali\\\" is not only the start of a highly recommended trilogy (the so called \\\"Apu trilogy\\\") but also the first film of the legendary Indian director Satyajit Ray.It is hard to believe that his entire team as well as himself were busy on their first ever film project.According to Ray himself the first half of the movie is not satisfactory as it is in some ways amateurish.The second half however is very fluent.These are his words and although I concur with his analysis I have to say that the first half is also of a high level.The second part however is truly great and even more so when you remember that it is his first movie ever.That the movie was finished is all thanks to the West Bengal Government who saw some parts of it and wanted to finance the rest,since Ray's money was all spend. As said,the first half is a bit slow and incoherent but that doesn't take away it's overall drama and power.Most of the actors were unexperienced but that doesn't really show.All star performances are from Chunibala Devi as the old \\\"Auntie\\\" (she died before release),Uma Das Gupta as \\\"Durga\\\" and Subir Bannerjee as the young \\\"Apu\\\".These two youngsters played only in this movie,I wonder what ever happened to them. My favorite performance comes from Karuna Bannerjee as she plays Durga's and Apu's mother,a very powerful and convincing role it is.The story is about family life in rural Bengal and although there are several great scenes in the movie my favorite one is the scene in which Durga is sick and her mother tries to cure her in the middle of the night while the storm is raging outside.This scene is so realistic that it actually feels that you are there,the chills came over me.The next morning Durga has died and left her mother helpless while the father (played by Kanu Bannerjee) is returning from his voyage in search of money.Another important part of the movie (besides Ray's great directing) is the music of Ravi Shankar,who is best known for his friendship in the late sixties with \\\"The Beatles\\\" (listen to \\\"Within or Without You\\\" on the legendary album \\\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\\").The music can be annoying to some people because of the always present \\\"Sitar\\\",but to me it is a necessary add-on to the movie. For me as a film lover this movie was very much an experience since it was the first Indian movie that I say.I've rented the entire trilogy so I can't compare them yet,but I will do so in the comments on the other two. Anyway,as I am a film lover (and future Film student in September) this was a personal must see.After watching it I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy and other Ray movies.9\\/10 (currently number 61 in my top 100)\",\"148\":\"In 1956, \\\"Pather panchali\\\" opened to the least possible fanfare at the Cannes Film Festival. It was shown at midnight the same time there was a party in honor of Akira Kurosawa, and only a handful of film critics bothered to attend the screening. We can be thankful for the ones who did, among them Bazin, Moskowitz and Anderson. They demanded the film be shown again, and the rest is history. I paraphrase from the essay \\\"Distant Music\\\" written by Philip Kemp, available in the booklet for \\\"Jalsaghar\\\" ('The Music Room', 1958), released by the Criterion Collection.Ray is absolutely amazing. \\\"Charulata\\\" (1964) was my first love, after which I was able to see this and then \\\"Jalsaghar\\\". Now I've been going through his select filmography, and I'm going to have to visit Charu again in the near future.Just like \\\"Jalsaghar\\\", the three films that are the Apu trilogy are an overwhelmingly sober account of life and death, and everything in between. Each film is structured around death, and normally we would have reconciliation. But here we have perceived reconciliation through death, \\\"perceived\\\" in the sense that each time it's short of complete; something is left unsaid, something is amiss. It's all quite shocking, really. Emotionally very draining, and this is Ray's absolute gift. He is able to touch upon a subject like this and examine it whilst retaining a sense of vitality, allowing him not to succumb to heavy-handed melancholy (something I feel Bergman occasionally swerved to) but instead stay rooted in life \\u2013\\u00a0bittersweet, full of hope, sometimes unanswered.There are some iconic and haunting images in this film that are yet to be matched in their intensity. A beautiful death poem, and a life poem, as well.\",\"149\":\"I won't go into detail about this film, because the greatest films ask that you really just sit back and enjoy them without questioning. This is in a very very small handful of films that create a kind of 'ecstatic truth' that Werner Herzog is always talking about. There is not a moment of hand-fed emotion, and that's probably what hits you first after the film is finished. This is probably why the film has not hit even the first 250 on the IMDb list, while it is more easily accessible than, say, most 'foreign' pictures, it still refuses at every turn to make a clich\\u00e9 out of itself or to be unfair to the audience or its characters by making its machinations obvious, a ploy that most filmgoers fall for time and time again. A reason for this might be that Ray, a young director at the time who had already worked with Jean Renoir on his landmark film about India called 'the River', really didn't have a lot of money or power to wield around, and made this tight, intimate story on a shoestring with an amateur crew, without real concern for anything else but this story that he wanted to tell. A lot of that comes across - the locations, the actors - were all real, however this is a work of masterful collaboration between director, cinematographer, actors, sound recordist, and particularly the editors, a collaboration that is unparalleled in most modern, big budget films. This is a movie created solely with passion, and I am joining in the crusade to make this one of the top 250 on IMDb, though it should, by default, belong on the top 10 of anybody's list.\",\"150\":\"I do like dramas. Especially romantic ones. Yet, the social dramas, portraying society are great too. For past few years I have seen a handful of them and enjoyed very much. But this one just doesn't work for me. Apart from nice shots here and there, nothing us catching my attention.That's the story of Apu, but he doesn't look like a main character here. He is like an observer. His sister and parents are boring. The old aunty or granny, whoever she is, is the most compelling character. I understand that drama is not action therefore it has slow pacing, but drama doesn't need chases or explosions to be dynamic. Give characters a purpose, change locations, make a main character meet new people. That will bring life to the movie and it will not feel as static.Look at Capernaum and its main character, who is also a little child. There is a problem that he has to solve, there is a journey, that he takes, there is a dozen of characters that he encounters. Love this movie. It is heart wreaking drama, but it is amazingly well done\\nThis movie is so boring and with no development, I put it on *1.5 speed and still got bored\\nThe movie is not interesting in the slightest.Sure, it is a three movie story. And second and third movie might have what I crave for. But how can I be interested in the continuation of the story if the author couldn't make me be invested into the characters.I gave it a try, I really wanted to like the movie. I didn't drop it in the very beginning. But I cannot watch it anymore.\",\"151\":\"Watching this made me feel like a prick just for worrying about things in my life, because I realised just how minute and trivial my life's \\\"troubles\\\" are by comparison. If you're planning on watching this then prepare yourself because things are about to get pretty damn somber for the next 2+ hours. I don't typically mind bleak films but there is only so much you can enjoy being miserable so I can't rate it any higher. This film wiped me out.. I'm done.\",\"152\":\"This movie is touching but along with reading subtitles, is very predictable from the very beginning. It's the kind of movie you only watch once.\",\"153\":\"There is this one scene in Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali when the eruption of a conflict between Apu's family and a quarrelsome neighbour brought the film to a complete standstill (for me anyway). Those few characters' state of mind and their relationship dynamics at that point in time, was conveyed with such explosive intensity, I got gut punched drunk.\\nPather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day. Pather Panchali is one of the best films I have ever seen. This will be a night to remember. Now on with the other two then.\",\"154\":\"The movie though made in 1950s, still relatable to today's world. Doesn't matter whether they are in urban or rural. It basically shows the family's rural life. The rural world, being unenlightened is shown strongly in the role of the little girl, who dies shortly. The old lady which is highly praiseworthy for her genuine involvement is still mystifying. I generally liked the dual sense hidden in the girls life. The father longs to earn money in the urban apart from his poetic abilities. The death of the little girl in the whole episode is so true even in the metaphorical sense. The girl represents the unenlightening existence. She is peaceful in rural life, sometimes gets scold from her mother. She has her private space in the movie, plays around the village, the natural experiences of her teenage. The scenario of the rural area matches in total of the girl unenlightened existence. She dies peacefully in rural area is a thought provoking issue regarding both fear and peace hidden in her life. It strikes me as the metaphor of unenlightening super power ends in the beginning of 20th century. A truly maestro's touch by Satyajit Ray in visualizations through human characters. Apart from that all the performers truly did thier part reflecting the genuine rural life of east India.Apu birth is the first part of the trilogy. It is followed by Apus study life and then his married life. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Indian movie. A fine start in depicting the story of Apu and his family. A must see masterpiece.\",\"155\":\"I have been saving this movie for a long time, telling myself over and over again, \\\"I'll get around to this someday\\\". Today, on the 100th birth anniversary of Satyajit Ray, the director, I finally got around to it; and I am in despair, and I am in love.This is a beautiful portrayal of rural life and the perils and pitfalls of poverty. The characterization in the screenplay reduces the pace of the film quite a bit, but it engages the audience and reels you in. You start rooting for the characters, and the payoff is especially bittersweet in the end. The cinematography is beautiful and the emotions are almost tangible. There is poetry in the frames, soul in the score, and everything comes together wonderfully.The actors are absolutely perfect in their roles. Every single actor is incredibly endearing and they will wring the emotions out of you. You will feel the pain, the despair, and the little moments of happiness. Satyajit Ray did a masterful job on this movie and I am not surprised that it won so many accolades and is still listed as one of the best movies of all time. This is a Gem.\",\"156\":\"What to say about this masterpiece?I think one would have to ransack the dictionaries to find any apt word to eulogize this movie.The human emotions portrayed in this work of art transcends the barriers of language,region,religion,culture.This film speaks in universal language.If you truly love the movie watch it without the subtitles,then watch it with the audio muted.The effects would be the same.I have been brought up in a culture where this movie is regarded as the ultimate creation of art though I deliberately did not watch the movie until I thought myself to be a little bit capable of appreciating the best work of Ray.I watched it at 27 and since then in the past two years I have watched it more than 27 times.Here are some of the remarks about the film-\\\"Pather Panchali is perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North.\\\"-TIME,\\\"as deeply beautiful and plainly poetic as any movie ever made. Rare and exquisite.\\\"-Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of LA Weekly, \\\"one of the greatest pictures ever made\\\"- Philip French of The Observer.Watch it as many times as you can and every time you will discover a new dimension of the movie.Sublime,humane,sensitive this pastoral elegy is Indian cinema at its best.And never forget this movie was made with a shoestring budget with amateur casts.\",\"157\":\"What can I put about this movie which has not been said or written before?! This movie  the entire Apu series itself] is the best from Ray. Technically, very sound. Speaking about sound, the music was composed by Ravi Shankar and it is so fit into the scenes. Movie is about life and how does it go on. Even though it has been cited to showcase poverty, I do not see that is ever pinpointed anywhere in the film, and there is no crying over it. This film actually does not say much. Some western critics mentioned about the theme of endless sorrow throughout the series, but I do not think this was made, or could be interpreted in that way. That kind of sorrow is part of the then life in our country. Let us not take the ending as a cliffhanger. Kudos to the actors too, but Ray even played the role of casting director well. Of course a great slice of credits goes to Bibhutihushan Bandyopadhyay for the awesome story and narrative about the serenity of nature, but that adaptation accusation applies for all the movies of Ray.\",\"158\":\"Pather Panchali (1955, Satyajit Ray\\u200b), a study of childhood\\u200b, is one of the greatest films of all time. Widely regarded as India's best movie, it is a major cultural landmark. It made an instant superstar out of Satyajit Ray. Despite the frequency of scenes depicting mundane life for a family of four peasants in India, \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" really packs an emotional punch.It is based on Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's 1929 Bengali novel. Apu (Subir Banerjee), a young boy, is the protagonist. In one of his earliest scenes, we wonder if he will wake up to face the day. Apu has a naughty older sister Durga (Uma Das Gupta). Durga's habitual lying and stealing causes conflicts with the neighbors. Sarbojaya Ray (Karuna Bannerjee), mother of Apu and Dirga, is frustrated with her daughter's ways but must defend her from accusation. The patriarch, Harihar Ray (Kanu Bannerjee) is emotionally distant from the troubles of the other three family members. He's a priest earning meager wages during the work day. At night he cheerfully writes poetry, plays and stories with the optimism his artistry can wipe out his family's debt. Indir Thakrun (Chunibala Devi) is the very old (80) aunt who also annoys the matriarch. The needy old woman is the picture of misery. (While Chunibala Devi died before the film was released, Ray had visited her and showed her an early version.)\\\"Pather Panchali\\\" was controversial at the time for its unflinching depiction of villagers experiencing bone-crushing poverty. Destitution is weighing everyone down, like gravity. There are scenes where characters eat rice with their fingers from a bowl on the floor and it feels like you have been transported to rural India. Yet the peasants are mostly stoic, and inspiring for how they generally cope with their burdens.Two performances really strike a chord. Karuna Bannerjee as the beleaguered, fatigued mother trying to discipline as well as hold her family together is amazing to watch. When she mentions during one moment of despair that she used to have dreams of a better life it really pulls heartstrings. Uma Das Gupta as Apu's naughty sister Dirga is also very memorable. The mother and daughter roles are both exquisitely realized. The 34-year-old novice director (Satyajit Ray) started his career at a very elite level.Ray begins the film with many scenes that are dark, even though the family seems to be prospering. When Fate has dealt the family a bad hand, the scenes are well lit and occasionally, in deep focus. The lighting pattern is counter to how many filmmakers would have approached the material. In addition, the conclusion is foreshadowed. Notice how often one character seems to occasionally stumble or falter. Regarding the music, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar\\u200b's score adds authenticity and depth to the narrative. Shankar's music is very highly regarded among film critics. It also inspired George Harrison about a decade later.For those who see \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" on the big screen, expect to emerge from the theater a changed and wiser person. Satyajit Ray demonstrates the world is available to a young artist who hasn't given his soul to the dark side.\",\"159\":\"What is life? How to embrace reality and find happiness in little things?Satyajit Ray examines and explores all these questions with the first part of his humanitarian trilogy 'Pather Panchali'. A film that reflects the social and political aspects of the society.The first and second act of the film focus on the struggles and the misfortunes that plague the family while also giving the audience a shred of hope with some small beautiful moments. In doing so, Satyajit Ray gave to this story a unique bittersweet taste. But even with all the suffering and misery, in the third act Satyajit Ray decides to end the first chapter of his trilogy with more bitterness, by showing the harsh reality of life, in the end, nothing changes and life seem repetitive for the main characters, making them fall into the absurdity of life. (A reference to the Sisyphus myth perhaps.)A masterpiece, I am very eager to finish the rest of the trilogy.\",\"160\":\"This film is tied with \\\"Aparajito\\\" (part two of the \\\"Apu Trilogy\\\") for my favorite film ever.  Part three, \\\"The World of Apu,\\\" seems a bit flawed by sentimentality and overly melodramatic qualities, but is still a masterpiece, if a more minor one. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" is visual and moral poetry, and provides enough thought-provoking material to last a lifetime--or more.  Meditation on the human truths exposed in these three films can be a very salutary thing. Satyajit Ray was one of the very great moral-centered filmmakers--which is not to say he's preachy or condescending, just the opposite: he does what great dramatists have always done from the Greeks through Shakespeare and onward, which is to search the human soul, compassionately revealing its weaknesses and strengths so that each member of the audience, if attentive, may learn more about himself or herself.What nobler purpose could drama, or film, serve?  It's a joy to see this done, and a privilege to witness the work of such a master.\",\"161\":\"'Pather Panchali' is an impressive film about life in a poor part of Indian subcontinent, where the people live a very basic life, and every day is a struggle.Meet the small Bengal family whose life is depicted in the film: Hardworking, conscientious mother, Sarbojaya; her dreamer husband Harihar, who writes stories that don't get used; their first-born, a girl, Burga who nicks fruit from the neighbour's orchards. And then the young boy, Apu, who goes to school and gets to learn to read and write. Living with the family at times is their elderly aunt.At insistence from his wife, Harihar gets a job, but only gets paid after three months. His wife is concerned about the lack of maintenance work at their home, but his reply always is that there is no money. But, incidentally, enough money for his tobacco. He eventually realizes that he must increase his income and leaves to find work in a large town.Months go by without a word from him, the family runs out of food and the wife has to sell her precious silverware to get food. When the husband eventually arrives back home, he was in for an unpleasant surprise...The film has many elements: it highlights the huge difference between how men and women were treated. A boy gets preferential treatment, gets to go to school and gets better food than his female siblings. The girls stay at home to assist their mothers with housekeeping chores. The film also effectively shows the dynamics between the poor and the very poor.This kind of subject matter can easily be sentimentalized, but it is handled with restraint. The natural cast is amazing, the black and white cinematography and sound track excellent. A masterpiece. 9\\/10.\",\"162\":\"Satyajit Ray made so many beautiful art films during our parent's time and we had to tolerate rubbish movies during this time.\\nThis movie is a masterpiece which is beyond any ratings.

Don't have anything to express.\",\"163\":\"WARNING: PRETTY BLATANT SPOILERS!That's basically what this film is -- a big home movie. It's production was initially about that sophisticated, it all takes place in the same neighbourhood, and the mother and daughter characters really are mother and daughter. The result of all this is that the film is far more affecting than it would have been if it had been more obviously made.This movie is based on a novel apparently, but there's really not much plot, simply because real life never has much plot. It's just plodding along from day to day, with interesting things occasionally happening along the way, and where only a sudden, horrible tragedy can really break things up. There is not one false note to be found in any of the characters, who are some of the most real I've ever seen. They each have their sweetnesses and their villainies, and you like them or not on balance of them. If you doubt how effective this is, I'll only say this: NEVER have I so hoped a character wouldn't die as I did when the climax of this film drew near.India is a country that seems to thrive on excess, both in its own Bollywood productions and in the sort of films it generates in Hollywood (Passage to India, Gandhi, Kama Sutra, for example). This is totally the other extreme, showing us the mundane, undramatic lives of the ordinary people. This doesn't even have the absolute-rock-bottom drama of Salaam Bombay. For most viewers, it's the sort of movie their life would adapt into.\",\"164\":\"I approached this movie with as much hesitation and trepidation as I would approach a book by Sartre, Camus, Nietzsche or music by Beethoven or Mozart or movies by Fellini or Kurosawa. I mean, you just can't watch a Satyajit Ray movie as if you are watching 'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun' or 'Wedding Crashers', especially when the movie is listed in all possible 'all time great' movies.'Pather Panchali' translates as 'Song of the road' and what a beautiful sonnet it turns out to be ! I have never seen before anywhere such beautiful portrayal of village life of India. As a master artist Ray has painted a poem on the canvas of celluloid. The beauty lies in the depiction of characters that are so real, I felt as if I am not watching a movie but actually living with them. Not a slightest of melodrama (that Indian movies are famous for), the movie is all about how life flourishes amidst extreme destitute. Its not the words, but the eyes tell the story. Eyes tell the story of joy and wondering of Apu, adolescent curiosity of his sister, forlornness and disappointment of his mother, hope of his father and prayers of his old wizened aunt.For me the most moving performance was given by the stooped wrinkled woman playing the old aunt who is waiting to die but wishing to live everyday fully. It reminds so much of our old grandmothers. And yet her death scene was shown so realistically without any histrionics, that you won't have anything but praise for the director.As some one said every frame of the movie is a work of genius. Be the births and deaths in the family, or the discovery of train or watching a musical, every scene is worth remembering. Top of that the soothing background score is heartwarming, thanks to Ravi Shankar. However, the best scene of the movie for me is where Apu finds the stolen beads in her dead sister's closet and disposes it surreptitiously to preserve her dignity.Only complaint that I have is, that it lacked a narrative story. May be it is just a prelude to the complete tale. Now, I so want to watch the other two movies of Apu trilogy.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)\",\"165\":\"Pather Panchali marked the introduction of Satyajit Ray, arguably India's finest filmmaker. Pather Panchali, based on Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay's identically titled novel, is the story of a small family in a rural Indian setting. Pather Panchali is the first film of the \\\"Apu Trilogy\\\", the three Ray films chronicling the life of Apu, a village boy, over the years. The film bears signs of what would make Ray a renowned name in world cinema in the years to follow. The immensely faithful portrayal of the life of the primary characters, complete with their hopes, dreams, petty troubles and idiosyncrasies, resonated deeply with the psyche of the Indian audience.\",\"166\":\"Pather Panchali is simply one of the most perfectly executed narrative films ever made. It is an extraordinary experience that really should be witnessed to be appreciated. The evocation of a specific place and time balanced with a profoundly \\\"universal\\\" humanism draws viewers into this film in intensely personal ways. This is one of the few films that has elicted some kind of respectful response from every person that I have talked to about it. Simply a masterpiece.\",\"167\":\"The movie is more than 60 years old but it didn't feel old even for a second and it will be same even after 60 more. This is what we get when a filmmaker puts his heart in making the movie. The best Filmmaking ever in Indian Cinema . Captivating music and memorable acting.\",\"168\":\"What can I say about this movie? What can be said about this movie that has not been said already? Each image and each scene is imprinted on my mind as if I was there when it all happened.First one from the Apu trilogy, this was also Satyajit Ray's debut film. It seems, Ray came across this Novel 'Pather Panchali' by Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay and became obsessed by making it into a movie. He had to face a lot of hardships but was somehow able to fulfill his dream. And what a debut it is. Each character and each scene is so real that this is not just realist cinema but reality itself.I always wonder how Ray got those performances out of children. No one seems to be acting or performing and yet it is so entertaining. Apu with a cardboard crown trying to copy that character from the play he watches, Durga trying to comprehend a telegraph pole, a stray dog following Durga and Apu as they follow the sweat vendor are scenes that make you wonder how did Ray got these so perfect. And he uses elements of nature to accentuate each of his scenes so well that each scene is complete in itself.I won't say the obvious like \\\"it's a masterpiece\\\" or \\\"it's a classic\\\" or \\\"it's brilliant\\\" because everyone has started using these terms for almost anything these days. All I will say is that it is one of the most beautiful movies that I have ever seen.\",\"169\":\"Mr. Satyajit Ray's The Apu trilogy is a journey with deep human emotions of a complete life. The first internationally acclaimed film of India. I never watched a bengali film till date all I heard is satyajit ray is legendary maker but when I checked imdb I thought I missed something being a movie buff then I started watching PATHER PANCHALI an unforgettable experience the poetic narrative adds beauty to it with its realistic making. Performances and bgm are outstanding. The Apu trilogy is highly recommended for every movie buff out there don't miss this timeless classic.\",\"170\":\"Speechless.. Yes that's the word that can describe the beauty of this movie. Oh wait, even that cannot, nothing earthly , be it words spoken or written can describe the splendor of this movie. Ray raises the art of movie making to ethereal levels. The human relationships and their subtleties portrayed in this movie have no parallels. The music suits the moods of the movie perfectly . Every person involved in the making of this movie - ranging from the cameraman to the actors - has put in the performance of his or her life time. Kudos to all ! Again words fail me in describing one of the best movies of the world. Apu the protagonist, his sister, his mom , his dad , his granny and their lives in the small village make the world in this movie. One has to see this movie to appreciate the nuances in this world consisting of fallible humans and their helplessness. Poverty and its effects are convincingly and realistically shown unlike most movies that seek to make drama out of poverty. This movie is etched in my memory forever. There is not much dialog in this movie and that adds to the beauty of this movie.\",\"171\":\"I know Satya Jit Ray sir is great director in indian film industry.

To call the story told largely without resort to dialogue, but very much with non-verbal sounds, visual imagery, including body postures and facial expressions, \\\"stunning\\\" is far from adequate. But the most honest thing one may be able to say about Satyajit Ray's tour de force is that although it should be required viewing for virtually everyone who takes their automobile, their computer, their cell phone, their paid vacation, and their \\\"right\\\" to \\\"live as they choose\\\" for granted... only those who know the Yogic Hindu and Pali Cannon Buddhist \\\"way\\\" will likely \\\"get it.\\\" For this is not only The Way Life Is for half the world's (over-) population even 60 years after it was first screened, this is proof that all our \\\"stuff\\\" is just that, regardless of how effectively it lulls us into our (supposedly) painkilling trance.\",\"173\":\"An accomplishment considering this is Ray's directorial debut and made on a very tight budget among other financial troubles.The camerawork is brilliant.

Pace is always the engine of a film according to me.All the performances in this movie have such innocence in them, which makes it terrific to watch.\",\"174\":\"What a wonderful film. For those who have not watched any films from India or heard of Ray, I strongly recommend it. Full of sadness, hope, innocence, and despair, it is an emotionally evocative portrait of the life of an Indian family, their trials, and their courage and persistence throughout. They go on, not because they are exceptional, but because they must, because they are human.Ray does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood, and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human, regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch, singing of her approaching death, are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today. At the risk of sounding trite, this is a film which is not merely entertainment or art, but one which reaches into your heart and makes a place for itself there. It belongs there.\",\"175\":\"Pather Panchali is and will be my favourite film. It's beauty lies in the aesthetic scenaries of village life. The cinematography is so brilliant!Thank you Satyajit Ray Sir. Thank you for making a film that is brilliant in itself.\",\"176\":\"For a black-and-white movie released 60 years ago, Pather Panchali was fairly engaging because it managed to keep me glued to the screen for two hours.However, it is not a complete story; it's more like the beginning of one. That could be because it's the first in a trilogy, but I feel that despite that, it would have been better for it to have followed at least roughly the traditional structure of beginning-middle-and- end, even if it was meant to be an adaptation of only the first part of the novel Pather Panchali.I didn't give it a rating of less than 7 stars because the focus and message of the movie were executed pretty well. The focus was upon childhood spent in poverty in a developing country, the message being that childhood is universal.In any case, Pather Panchali surely helped me achieve my initial purpose of, being from India, understanding Indian cultures different from my own, in this case the culture of Hindu Bengal.A note about the subtitles: English subtitles are great, but if you're like me and speak an Indian language that isn't Bengali, try finding subtitles in them instead of in English. I found Hindu subtitles online and they were much more accurate and culturally- appropriate than English ones, and using them challenged and consequently improved my ability to read Hindi.\",\"177\":\"Best acting for all actors\\nGood cinimotography\\nExcellent music\\nCaptain of the ship Rey was awasome... direction\\nIcon of Indian movie\",\"178\":\"After a long time I'm writing this review. This movie surely a masterpiece. It describes how life was for people back then. The brother and sister relationship was just awesome and it's really hard to find nowadays. I'd love if Durga survive. But this is what maybe was common back then..\",\"179\":\"Off late i have stopped writing about films because my perspective has progressed that films are not an essential and valuable service, apart from non outdoor entertainment provided which is required to have healthy mind. Also, films are one sided and not two way as people on screen and behind keep exhibiting their talent and we the viewers have no participation (example in sports-Tennis or Chess is two sided). But recently got inspired to come back into my favorite arena-(parallel) movies(commonly\\/colloquially known as non song movies, award cinema, art film, documentary, slow movies, elite film festival audience movie) after getting inspired from a TV show accidentally i watched while changing channel, where Indian film director told that his favorite personality is Satyajit Ray(a veteran with Oscar and Bharat Ratna to his credit). While saying there was a special spark in his eyes. Then i came back to this movie called Pather Panchali - Song of the little road(1955) which was released 61 years ago(was in development hell for 3 years indeed), which is Mr.Ray's first movie with no experience in films except for watching, analyzing and discussing them. Unresisted to watch the movie despite the criticism on Rays movie as selling poverty abroad, lack of modernism,melodramatic and slow.Needless to say, movie is sourced to a literature as like any parallel movie should be. The film is into 5 characters of lower middle class family set in rural India. Rays movie has deeper touch with realism, story being natural and so the characters(in simple-the style is into absorbing story and characters strongly, parallel movie trademark). His style is more focused on characters. Its a chilling experience and a break from blood and gore and over romantic, repeat artificial routine movies in recent and past trend. Characters moments of living life as a human being is captured in close shots which is overwhelming. The boys reaction to his sisters beating and making-up with a mustache as a man after watching a theater performance and enjoying the rain with his sister is close to heart. Not to miss the deepness of Apu's love to sister when the movie ends he throws away the beads(which his sister stole and got beaten) to protect her reputation.The end of movie is heart breaking to be not in touch with the family we enjoyed overseeing while they are living. The chilling experience is deep because of the family living in a natural surrounding-lovely nature ambiance. People who have suffered lack of humanity in real life will enjoy this movie of 2 hours and 6 minutes for sure. Fiction seated in realism some or most of the times is purely enjoyable because we already built a stage(as we can closely match the realism in our life) to launch a fiction on top of it.\",\"180\":\"All those giving 10\\/10 must like sad, sullen stories. Hardly much to the story, poor family and their struggle, woman sighing and sulking away. Sorry, not much there. No strong characters. In 1955 it was first glimpse into impoverished Indian village life , so got some awards and S. Ray kept showing same sad, poverty striken characters in his stories. Not much to sit and watch for 6 hours+ of this trilogy.\",\"181\":\"One recurring theme is the precondition, the act and the aftermath of theft of goods belonging to the neighbor: the children first steal vegetables, then even the beads of a necklace, finally only a coconut which had fallen from a tree due to the Monsoon wind. The embarrassment caused is understandable, as the people are very poor.There was at least funny scene: a kitten playing with a dog. Else the kittens are always kept at their neck (as if we could not keep them under their belly) and thrown to ground.In an extraordinary scene we see a Bengali steam train passing by, and the boy running beneath it. The boy, as meager as he is, anyway seems at every opportunity be running through backyard and field.Note that I wrote SILENT PICTURES, not SILENT MOVIE, because this film makes a persistent static impression. So that I fell twice into sleep, something which had never happened to me before. Hitchcock warned not to make films by photographing people who are talking. This films shows a lot of scenes with mother, children, neighbors talking. In addition, we become witness of how to cook under that environment.What kept me a bit under suspense: the people always walk or run bare-feet through the bosky backyard and garden, as if there could never be a snake.The sound was of bad quality, the soundtrack by Ravi Shankar, too. It is not sufficient just to play the sitar a fast a possible.I have the impression that it is the one and same person who wrote the other reviews, which are too good to be true. Or maybe they are employees of the Bengali film office, since that was the sponsor and producer of the work.I have written reviews for films which are nearly 100 years old (and they are FAR better than this one). I have also annotated another upbringing film: Padre Padrone. Thus I don't consider it primarily due to my lack of understanding that I cannot agree with the adulations here.\",\"182\":\"I previously heard about Satyajit Ray, often considered among the greatest filmmakers of the 20th century, but had never seen any of his films or any Bengali films at all for that matter until last week. The Apu Trilogy is usually regarded as his magnum opus, while the first part of the trilogy, Pather Panchali, was the first film he ever made. I finally decided to watch it (with subtitles) last week.I'm usually into watching more fast-paced films, so I wasn't quite used to Pather Panchali's slow pace at first. The film started out interesting, then got a little slow in the middle, and then picked up again in the last third which managed to keep my interest throughout. By the time I was finished watching the film, I found myself staring blankly into the screen for some time while in deep thought. I still couldn't forget about the incredibly moving ending, which was simple yet touched me in a way very few films before ever have, not to mention the unforgettable music by Ravi Shankar (whose music I had previously only heard in some Beatles songs but his earlier music in Pather Panchali was far more effective). It was probably one of the most powerful and memorable endings I've ever seen.9\\/10\",\"183\":\"One of the best movies from India. Period.\\nThe relationship between the siblings is probably one of the most authentic and raw portrayal in cinema. I've gotta watch more of Satyajit.\",\"184\":\"This astoundingly powerful movie depicts the life of a poor \\\"Brahmin\\\" family in a rural Indian village. The movie conveys the power of hope that can sustain ordinary people beset by the most hopeless of circumstances. The acting was sublime. I wonder where they found the woman who played the old auntie. Rake-thin and bent over, she could convey entire worlds of meaning with her sunken eyes. I don't want to even try to explain the movie, conveying the essence of this one is beyond my abilities. I could not get this movie out of my mind for weeks. I am not the sort of person who even remotely feels like crying during movies, but this one had me weeping like a child.Magnus.\",\"185\":\"I don't even think myself as someone who could write comment on Satyajit Ray's movie. But I have to tell people what I feel about this movie Pathar Panchali. Let me ask you a simple question have you ever been 'moved' emotionally? Well! If you have! Then you know what I am talking about, but you haven't been then I am sure you want try that out. Watch this movie and then you will know. Pathar Panchali is a very different movie and is not about romance, wealth, beautiful faces, relationships, cars, computers and cellphones. Not about bombs, wars, jails, science, space and fiction or whatever. The movie is the first one in famous Apu Trilogy and is about a poor brahmin family in West Bengal (India). It is an story of a girl in this family, how she grew up among in a poverty stricken family and never had a chance to all things (garland of fake pearls, dolls, candies, bi-scope and hair oil) a girl kid deserves. She grew up a very good girl despite the fact she never went to school. Her brother was born when she was about 5-6 and she loved him a lot. Her plays with her villages girls were very well done. The scenes when one of her friend got married were wonderful and show that how mature she was in her thinking that she is never going to get married was more than a reality. The story captures real moments (hard to describe here!) from a typical poor family in India when (1955) it was not even a decade since India got independence. Poverty was a real issue in India during 1955 and it was Ray's vision to capture it in his movies for generations to see after hundreds of years later what India has come out of today when Bollywood makes $10bn budget movies and they fail to even break-even on box office.Its amazing that Ray had a vision of making such movies when rest of the country was struggling to survive. These movies are really really low cost movies and are example of pure intellectual work. When I was one of the Italian movie \\\"La Strada\\\" then I thought that perhaps it is the only movie which comes close to Pathar Panchali.I would say all three movies in Apu Trilogy (Pathar Panchali, Aparajito and Apu Sansar) are great jewels in Indian cinema and they will continue to amaze people for hundreds of years. If you haven't watch them then you will never know what a true will looks likes. It moves you! No kidding! Pathar Panchali is really a best human document ever produced.\",\"186\":\"One of the Best from India. Satyajit Rai's classic.\",\"187\":\"Exotic (Adjective)- 1. Strangely Beautiful THE GENRE Ray developed a language of his own through the Apu trilogy- a slow, lush, languid, lyrical language reminiscent of enchanting poetry in the most maudlin and mundane circumstances. He didn't ostracize poverty nor did he glamorize it, He didn't exploit it but merely romanticized it. He found romance and beauty in the most hideous of circumstances. It was like a pain that was so severe that the agony became sweet, a sore so deep that its anguish felt sensuous. Like death- so terrifying that it's freeing, exonerating. It's the kind of erotic pain one feels in the muscles after a hard day's work. You want to laugh at the pain almost with contempt and with a condescending, patronizing attitude, never realizing that it is your own pain that you're laughing at. But you want to wallow in it all the same because you think that it'll make you more profound and hence you're thankful for it having been bestowed upon you THE TREATMENT Ray gave an explanation to the people who have a problem with the pacing of the film by saying that the slow rambling rhythm of the film was a clue to the subject matter itself, as villages in rural Bengal do, in fact, ramble. Pather Panchali has numerous colloquial anecdotes in chaste Bengali but despite the localized context, the message of the film is universal because pain and suffering knows no boundaries- they transcend and pervade our hearts, overcoming mythical barriers of race, religion, nationality, language, time, place and other such superfluous demographic constraints. Pather Panchali is ultimately a comment on the indomitable insubordination of the human soul THE POETRY Ray is rather unforgiving in his vision. He chooses stark landscapes sans an iota of conventional beauty and surrounds his world with equally pathetic and ugly faces but he finds a beauty amongst them that is so pristine and divine. He literally hears the beating of a heart in the throbbing of a wound. The small moments- a torn bed sheet (torn, mind you and thereby being an article that if placed in any other film, would conventionally arouse feelings of sadness but not in Pather Panchali for here that very article becomes a magnificent artifact) through which Apu's eyes can be seen for the first time when we see him as a child. It assumes an artistic expression of its own. The kaleidoscope becomes a voyeuristic instrument, enabling a glimpse into the world of fantasy albeit one that is decidedly and inexplicably, out of their reach. The simple act of following a sweetmeat seller and the hope of eventually extracting some savories from him or from the house he's selling them to, becomes a 'chase sequence', the tragic mood uplifted by the lilting Sitar music by Ravi Shankar. We feel victorious when Durga is given sweets by her young friend right under the disapproving gaze of her bitter mother. THE TRAGEDY 'Song of the little road' is a joyous journey through a road of unbearable suffering. Tragedies are many- the death of the aunt being the first moment, Apu's first encounter with death. Whether he fully comprehends the situation or not is debatable but the indelible impression of this one incident on his nubile mind, is not. Then, the second tragedy- the death of Durga, Apu's sister and his best friend is even more heartbreaking than the earlier tragedy simply because of the higher shock value it has. Durga is in many ways the protagonist of this film. Apu is merely a bystander who observes rather than experiences most situations in this film. It is Durga- playful and protective, child and woman, innocent and naughty- so captivating is Uma Dasgupta's performance that the viewer falls in love with the character and therefore cannot quite accept her death in the film. Why she was here just a few moments ago- playing carelessly in the rain with Apu and then, suddenly, nature seems to have defeated her but isn't there a lesson in that? The lesson being that it took death to conquer her undying spirit, for she wouldn't have succumbed to her circumstances while alive. It's as if she was saying- \\\"You may take my life away but you'll never conquer my spirit\\\". Her presence wraps the film like a halo and she is enshrined forever in the viewer's hearts. Another exemplary sequence is the one where Durga and Apu run out of their house to watch the trains go by. The haunting look in Apu's utterly captivated eyes touch the viewer. Steam Engines, like the kaleidoscope, are again a symbol of movement and fantasy and yearning for an outside world and these symbols of change and freedom become even more evident when seen within the startling paradoxical context of their waking existence of stillness in their never changing lives that they partake everyday like bonded labor. The difference between Yesterday and Today is barely discernible in their village where life follows the hum drum of a set pattern. So set that it's almost a sacred ritual. THE INSIGHTS Relentless in its pursuit of reality, Pather Panchali is a neo real masterpiece. I have been fortunate enough to have visited the actual location where Pather Panchali had been shot. The landscape is still the same, still as barren, the sons and daughters of the villages still look like Apu and Durga, Ray's voice still seems to resonate through the hollow tree barks and Ravi Shankar's soulful Sitar strings still peek from behind the antediluvian cobblestones. Because just like an old painting, the colors may have dried and got slightly discolored, but Ray's impeccable genius is still visible through the Gothic canvas.\",\"188\":\"For sure this is a beautiful and haunting movie.  I can only echo the comments of other viewers who rate it a masterpiece.  Those who are looking for action should stay away though.  This is a fascinating look at life in rural India, but also has a lot to say about the human experience.  All aspects of film-making are outstanding but, for me, the Ravi Shankir score made the film.\",\"189\":\"This is the actual depiction of Indian cinema. Less talk more visual story telling.

Of course, the metaphor is scathing because Hollywood is no paradigm of brilliance. Bollywood is the dumber to Hollywood's dumb.

When looking for other good Indian movies, you must look at either the films of Bengal or Kerela.Other Ray movies not to be missed: The rest of the Apu Trilogy (duh),The Music Room, Charulata (Ray's and my favorite), and Devi.\",\"191\":\"First I wanna say it's Ray's film.

What more you can say of this movie..a masterpiece, oh no!! I think you have to term a word which is more superlative than \\\"superlative\\\". It's a pity the year \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" was released there was no Oscar category for foreign language films, otherwise, India would have won one, of course, if the Indian government had chose to send this above the bollywood movies.I liked one of the comments of the reviewers, if Hollywood is 'dumb' then bollywood is 'dumber'. Really speaking, I doubt if anyone in India can ever cross the brilliance of this film, hailed as a masterpiece! At least tell me any B'wood films which even comes half close, not even the over rated \\\"Lagaan\\\"!! This movie and of course, other Ray's movies are intelligent, real and visualistic art. So what are the b'wood ones: tissue papers....and the worst part of it is years after years these \\\"dumber\\\" movies have been sent for Oscar nominations incessantly! Time to grow up b'wood, isn't it?? And what the foreigners see?? The scraps of the traditional bollywood \\\"dumber\\\" movies; what they miss: the excellence of the regional Indian movies!! Hey, are you listening Bollywood??\",\"194\":\"Last weekend it was my fortune to see the entire Apu trilogy at the DIA Film Theater. It was a pleasure and relief after reading stories of burned negatives of Satyajit Ray films and anxiety that seeing his films again after 40 years may be a disappointment. I had seen a clutch of his films at a festival in Bombay and had seen Pather Pancheli again in late 70's as a student in U.S. I had not seen the other two films in the trilogy, Aparajito and Apur Sansar before. It was great to see all three films in a two day span, but this also helped me obtain perspective on this great filmmaker. Pather Panchali is superlatively great. Nothing in Indian film repertoire approaches it for its freshness, naturalness, authenticity, playfulness and ability to relate its experience to the audience. Words are inadequate to describe how affecting Chunibala Devi is as an 80 year old close to death. She walks back and forth from being a beggar\\/thief to a loving aunt to Apu and Durga. In the extreme conditions she lives in, there is no contradiction in the two roles. Subeer Banerjee as Apu is absolutely charming and Uma Dasgupta as Durga with her rebelliousness and budding sexuality breaks our heart. The photography of Subrata Mitra has few equals in B\\/W film world. It is not only beautiful; it finds beauty in the most unexpected places such as tattered huts and dark unlit interiors; but is also expressive and lyrical. Ravi Shanker's music is mostly enchanting, but occasionally a little too overpowering for the gentleness of the scene. Kanu Banerjee as the hopelessly romantic father and Karuna Banerjee as the ever suffering mother are excellent.One can view Pather Pachali is the story of India's urbanization. From the beginning, the life in the village is hard and there are always stories about jobs and opportunities in distant cities. The railroad tracks outside the town beckon Apu and Durga and fill them with wonder when they finally see a train passing by. There is no electricity in the village (or running water, paved roads etc), and the electric lines outside town hum and sing to the two children, singing the song of modernization and breakup of the rural culture. It is inevitable that the family will end up leaving the village and our hearts collectively ache about this possibility and are afraid for them. Their pain is palpable as they leave in a rickety bullock cart, and Satyajit Ray makes us share that pain. What an astonishing achievement!After the glorious achievement of this first film, the other two films disappoint. Aparajito seems mostly to be a transitional piece and Apur Sansar ends on an oddly sentimental note. Although death comes regularly in all three films, it is less and less able to shock and sadden as the trilogy wears on. When the last death occurs in Apur Sansar, it seems gimmicky. Subrata Mitra is still spectacular and watching Sharmila Tagore as the bride of Apu is a treat in itself, but most other characters seem wooden and the storyline increasingly becomes artificial. Worse, Satyajit Ray does not seem to have a good grasp of or a point of view about the city life as he does about village life in Pather Panchali. This is especially true when the story shifts to Calcutta in the third film. It is difficult to identify or sympathize with the grown up Apu and we become less and less interested in his fate. Too bad. I loved Apu in Pather Panchali and still cared about him in early parts of Aparajito, but by the end of the trilogy, he seemed more a stick figure created by Ray, than a flesh and bones human being. To me the Apu trilogy had lost its humanity.\",\"195\":\"I don't know how even 6.4% of the female voters could have given this movie a 2!!!!!

Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a \\\"kash\\\" field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter?

The \\\"story\\\" here might only make sense if it's a kind of prelude or first chapter to what will unfold in the succeeding parts of the trilogy. But after the drudgery of this first one, I'm not inclined to look further.But for all that, the cinematography and other filmic qualities are of good quality. Too bad Ray couldn't have put his skills to a more fully developed and insightful script.\",\"197\":\"It's Satyjit ray, who makes rare mistake in his entire carrier...&\\nit's his dream creation to present the real emotions,situations etc of former village life....\",\"198\":\"*** WARNING: SPOILERS ***The three films Pather Panchali, Aparajito and Apur Sansar form a trilogy, and, although each holds up well in itself, they are best viewed as a unity. Speaking on a purely personal note, I know of no greater achievement in cinema, and have certainly seen nothing that moves me more profoundly.The twin themes of these films are progress and loss. The former implies the latter, and both are, in a sense, inevitable. This is, as all summaries must be, an over-simplification. Certainly, the loss of childhood, of innocence, of parents, is universal to the human condition. Growing up, progressing from childhood to maturity, is similarly inevitable. But Apu wills his progress: at least, he wills its direction. He always grapples with life, painful though it is. Only once, after the death of his wife (in the third film of the trilogy), does he turn his back upon life, but this crisis is temporary: the trilogy ends with Apu once again facing the future willingly, uncertain though it is.It is this refusal to turn one's back, to stagnate, this refusal to renounce, that forms the backbone of this trilogy, and gives it a unity throughout its often disparate episodes. The central character of these films, Apu, always aspires towards becoming something greater, other than what he is. He wants to educate himself. This, in a western context, appears somewhat obvious, but, given Apu's background, education is something to strive towards, to struggle for; and Apu, despite great temptation, never abandons this struggle. It is not that he sees education as a means towards wealth or power: this is not, after all, anything so crude as a rags to riches story. But he does want to outgrow the village, to understand, and come to terms with life and the larger world outside. And in this he is, as is suggested by the title of the second film, aparajito, undefeated.Over the three films, we see Apu progress from childhood to, perhaps, his early thirties. In this progression, we see his character develop through experience. This experience is often painful, and Apu is not always capable of rising above the pain. Perhaps no other film has depicted with such a terrible intensity the emotional pain of loss; but the vision, ultimately, is far from tragic. The last film - Apur Sansar - actually ends with a sense of joy. The joy is by no means unqualified: it has been hard won, and we, the audience, recognize its fragility. But it is, nonetheless, exhilarating.Pather Panchali, the first of the trilogy, takes place some time early in the 20th century, and covers the years of Apu's early childhood. We see him born into a poverty-stricken family in rural Bengal. Later, we see Apu at play with his sister, Durga; we see him excited by the travelling players; we observe the uncomprehending wonder of Apu and Durga as they see a train for the first time. We are shown all those events of childhood that are apparently trivial, but which nonetheless shape the adult personality.Apu's mother Sarbojaya (the superb Karuna Banerjee), is understandably harassed, trying to keep her family clothed and fed. The father, Harihar, is good-natured, other-worldly, and quite unpragmatic. With the family lives an aged aunt, Indir. She is a pathetic figure, helplessly eking out a meagre existence on the charity of those who barely have enough for themselves, and relying on Durga - with whom she has a close relationship - to supplement her inadequate diet with stolen fruit. Aware of her status, Indir generally speaks and acts in an ingratiating and conciliatory manner; but there is a repressed rage within her that bursts out on occasion. It is a magnificent performance from the aged actress Chunibala Devi. Sarbojaya has no patience with this old woman, and takes little trouble to hide the fact that she is unwanted. This is not out of deliberate cruelty, or indifference: it is simply that looking after her own immediate family is burden enough. The old woman, desparately trying to retain the last vestiges of her dignity, is forever storming out, attempting to find a roof to shelter under from some other relative. But she keeps returning: even a hostile roof, after all, is preferrable to none. It is a picture of desperation which moves the heart beyond mere pity. There is one particularly heart-rending scene where she sits in the dark singing of death in her old, cracked voice.This first part of the trilogy ends in tragedy - Durga's death - and I know of nothing in cinema that delivers so powerful an emotional punch. It took me quite unawares at first viewing, and even on repeated viewings, it moves me like nothing else I have seen. Particularly unforgettable is Apu's final, quiet act of love for his dead sister, which really needs to be seen in its proper dramatic context to be appreciated. It is the end of a chapter in the family's life, and they move on. The sense of loss is overwhelming.This is perhaps the best film ever made about childhood. I watch the entire trilogy about once every year, and wonder afresh at what cinema, at its best, is capable of achieving.\",\"199\":\"A movie that, even half a century later, remains the best cinematic depiction of rural life.We mostly watch movies for entertainment, and that's what they deliver. Very rare are those movies that touch you to the core, leaving you with a burden of thought in your mind and a tear in your eye. Pather Panchali is one such movie.To think that this was the first work of a director using equipment that even in those times were outdated, is unbelievable. Each scene resonates with you, touching different corners of your soul.There is hardly any dialogue in the film but the story unfolds through actions, emotions and ponderous silences. Yes, it is slow, but by choice. At no point does it feel cumbersome or plodding, but has a beautiful flow to it as you seamlessly move from one beautifully crafted setting to another, giving you time to immerse yourself into each, transporting you to the world of Apu and Durga.Pather Panchali is a film that can be uttered in the same breath as the greats of world cinema. A bow to the master, Satyajit Ray, for this piece of perfection.\",\"200\":\"I love foreign films because they tell the truth of the human condition unlike Hollywood-studio movies that usually sugar-coat life. Foreign films like The 400 Blows, Summer, Ikiru, Wild Strawberries, Early Spring, Late Autumn--all had a profound effect on me. They were like the independent films of today.I should like Pather Panchali, but I didn't. Yes, it told the truth of the human condition. Yes, it had beautiful cinematography. Yes, it had an effective soundtrack. But that was it. It didn't have anything else. Let me put it this way--it didn't emotionally move me like the above- mentioned films. Why? Probably because of a lack of character development. The father is hardly even in the film. The mother is a witch to her daughter. The aunt is a caricature of an old woman who means well. Same goes for the daughter. The son comes late in the film and basically copies whatever the daughter does. The neighbors are like the bad people in a chorus of a Greek tragedy. How can anyone be emotionally moved by characters like these?! They were all pretty much one-dimensional. And to top all that off--there was no plot! Well, I wasn't surprised to see that because how can you have a plot when you have only static characters. I do not recommend this film.\",\"201\":\"An absolute wonder, from beginning to end.

There were many things I never really understood at that time in the novel. I read it again after growing up, as a young man. I first saw the film in 1973 at a film festival in India. In 2004, I bought the trilogy on a visit to India and watched all the three films more than three times. It is an indescribable experience. Words fail me to express the intensity of the film in its visual beauty, thematic power, splendid acting, unbelievable camera-work and haunting music by Ravi Shankar. I do not know the names of all the actors, actresses and technicians, but I have never gone through such an experience except when watching movies by Ingmar Bergman. Satyajit Ray took Indian cinema to the world stage, not through the hollow men and women at Hollywood, but through the Berlin Film Festival, Cannes Film Festival, etc. The sensitivity of his films makes watching them the best cinematic experience. I have unabashedly awarded it 100%.Watch all the three films, if you watch this one.\",\"203\":\"The above title is not mine, rather than the great giant of cinema, Akira Kurosawa's. (creator of The Seven Samurai, Rashomon.) I can't help but quote a few from Andrew Robinson's Book \\\"The Apu Trilogy - making of an epic\\\" \\\"(after describing the 'wobbling sweet seller' sequence) The brief wordless interlude of lyrical happiness belongs uniquely to the cinema; it is the kind of peak in Ray's work that prompted Kurosawa to conclude;'Not to have seen the cinema of RAY means existing in the world without seeing sun and moon.'\\\" What can the 'humble' I say about one of the all time best films produced by world. There are lyricism, a lot place of poetry, from Marie Seaton to our critic Amitava Chattapadhyay..they are the renowned man who described about this. One can read the books by those I've mentioned, and also by Andrew Robinson's. Personally I can say, Ray is the man from whom I learned everything and still I'm learning. I'm learning not only how to read a film, but also how to write English! I am far younger than him, probably my age is similar to age of his grandson, but he's my Teacher, of all kind..from cinema to literature to painting to photography and music.

A film is an art form which can profoundly have an impact on society.\\nFilms have a lot of influence on me. Growing up watching movies of foreign languages and different cultures have helped me to approach the world more broadly and to accept the diversities. I moved to the United States from India few years ago. Because of the films and the books I have read, to an extent, I was able to adapt very quickly into this society and embrace the cultural differences.\\nWhen I was in 10th grade, my teacher screened the film \\\"PatherPanjali\\\"(1955 )directed by Satyajit Ray which was adapted from an autobiographical tale written by author Bibhuthibhushan Bandyopadhyay in 1929. The movie is about a Brahmin family, an impoverished priest (Harihar Ray), his wife and two children ( Durga and Apu) struggling to make both ends meet. Though the film deals with the struggle for survival by a poor family, what the director has tried to project instead is the respect for human dignity. The film as a whole seems tragic but it is a lot more than that. It is full of love, care, share and humanity that is fading away in this current era. The director has used the cues and signals from nature at it's best for picturizing the mood of the scenes. Despite the movie was dated for my generation (come on! What does 15-year-old know about film appreciation), unlike my classmates, during the film I was in a different emotional state. That was the first time I see the struggles of poor old villagers who even steal Guavas to calm the hunger and later on takes one's life. That was the first time I see how social status and pride overrules the humanity. Watching those scenes made me sick in my heart. At the same time, even in adverse circumstances, the children enjoy their childhood, sharing, caring and living in the moment exploring and exposing the mountains, rivers and the forest happily made me question whether the inconveniences I had is even a matter to consider. After the movie was over, I felt ashamed of myself for being ungrateful towards such a beautiful life I live. This movie made me question why people choose pride over dignity (the mother's pride took precedence over daughter's death) or is those words are some thing that is often misintrepret all the time.\\nThis movie completely shifted my approach towards cinema. After that film, I always try to pick movies that stir intense emotions and reach me at a deeper level.\",\"206\":\"Even though I'm of Indian decent, I only visited India on holiday but I've lived in an Indian community in South Africa. This movie reminds me of my childhood, the way the old aunties and grannies used to be in our Indian neighbourhoods but it wasn't as rural as it was in India and my generation was a few decades later. Yet, I related very closely to this film.I grew up watching many Bollywood films in our family, with our parents and I'd yearn for the quality Bollywood of older times. Satyajit Ray doesn't provide that Bollywood nostalgia but he provides total realism that I haven't seen in Indian cinema - to his level. I mostly love the way his characters are free to walk around the rural areas and their simple pleasures in the field, going toward the train and playing with water. Being about children, it is playful but also very serious with the way Ray depicts the grandmother and her relationship with the children's mother. I've been calling her grandmother, but i wasn't sure if she was just an old lady\\/aunty in the village or a blood relative. I might've missed that but it's all the same as she was treated as a relative and I think in Indian communities they could've adopted this responsibility to take care of her anyway. Ray isn't sympathetic to his characters, he shows us their ugly and beautiful side. He does this with the mother and children. He exposes some real weaknesses and his coverage of Apu is very dreamy, seemingly like himself. For me Pather Panchali is the best of the Apu Trilogy because its very real, but it's not easy to get going because it was Ray's first film and he was notably still mastering his craft at that stage.\",\"207\":\"A Truly brilliant film. Until I had seen the film in its entirety I had always heard others talk of the brilliance of these films but I myself had only seen bits over the years.

I heard a lot about Ray by then, & had already seen his \\\"Mahanagar\\\", which I did not appreciate.The first thing that struck me was the superb photography. Everything was shot in un-improvable fashion, from the marriage arrangements at the rich neighbours' house to the wrinkles on the old aunt's face.The second thing is that Ray's passion for the story comes through so clearly. I heard he gave up his job, and pawned his wife's jewelry to make this movie, but still did not have enough. He apparently kept on wondering if he would be able to make the movie before the boy who played Apu grew up or Chunibala Devi, the old aunt died.The beauty of the story grew on me over subsequent viewings. I even had the good fortune to view the entire Apu trilogy on three subsequent days - it was very clear that Pather Panchali stands head & shoulders even over the other two.Please see the movie.\",\"212\":\"The film follows a relative poor family through their up's and downs somewhere in India early in the 20th century. The family consists of a father who's a writer who has been in debt for years, without much success in paying it down. A mother filled with responsibility for the house and her rather careless daughter that the neighbors keeps making complaints about. Then we have Apu, the younger brother and the protagonist. What I personally found the most appealing in the film was the natural setting and feel to it. It's by far a more simplistic world, yet very authentic. In some way it also gave me a glimpse of nostalgia, just not my own.\",\"213\":\"Pather Panchali is one movie that touches the inner soul of whom so ever seeks to find themselves. Ray's extraordinary ability to bring out the most raw feelings from the audience without being the least bit dramatic is all visible in this first installment of his masterpiece.Although the story line is seemingly thin, its the depth and slow development of the characters that gets to the audience. Ray uses relationships as the strongest tool in his narrative, he breaks beyond the normal conventions of good or bad, but builds more on the 'nessesities of relationships'. One fact that surprised me in the comments is a lack of this understanding. For example Apu's mother and her Husband's old sister(the legendary old woman), they have a relationship pelted with nessesary Harshness. The scenes where the Old woman tries to bond with Apu's mother but without results is heartbreaking. Although at first you would think Apu's mother is a horrible person, on second thoughts you would realize she's simply putting her children before this woman who at an old age had become an extra mouth to spend for at home. Ray is so brilliant in his narrative that even the worst of worse characters gain the audiences sympathy.The beautiful camera work, music is something almost all reviews have inolved in them. Though before ending this review Id like to answer one question that haunts quiet a few people 'Why is this movie so great?' Well in all honesty amidst all the poverty, The characters in Pather Panchali live the most purest of lives, one devoid of the evils of politics, racism and all such Urban social evils and absurdities. They live among nature and touch on the very basics of life, something most of us can never feel because we're lost in a seemingly materialistic world.\",\"214\":\"I originally saw the Apu trilogy in 1961 in a little theater in Berkley. Sat through a straight showing of all three films and walked out after six hours in awe. It was a defining day in the development of an avid film buff. I have waited three years for the DVDs to be released, and hoped against hope that Criterion would get the rights, but it was not to be. Sony has released an unadorned, Mirchant and Ivory Foundation restoration: but they are finally available. I bought all three of the Trilogy the day they were released, but have been reluctant to put them on. So many of my memories of \\\"great\\\" films have made me wonder what I was on when I saw it to think that was great. Think \\\"Brewster McCloud.\\\" My experience of Pather Panchali and the full trilogy was a memory I didn't want diminished in any way. Tonight I came home from work, put the Pather Panchali in and sat totally rapt for the full two hours. The DVD production values and the print quality are really bad in spots, but all that fades as one of the really great art films takes over, and the immersion in the lives behind the film works its magic. Film doesn't have to be an act of corporate commerce: Pather Panchali is living proof that film can be a medium of great art.\",\"215\":\"Best of all time,I see the Apu trilogy for many of times\",\"216\":\"If u have enjoyed panther panchali and the APu trilogy then try to catch his other masterpieces like Mahanagar (The Big City) -- about lower middle class struggle and how some manage 2 keep up their conscience despite hungerJalshaghar (The Music Room ) -- reminiscences of a noble lord amidst the decaying settings of his ancestral palace.Chobi Biswas one of Bengal's finest actors gives an electrifying performance of one lost in the nostalgia of lost grandeurAgantuk (The Stranger) -- His last work.an absolute masterpiece in concept.An \\u00c3\\u00bancle' from past life suddenly appears in the life of a modern bengali home and he is immediately suspected of being con with uterior motives.City life makes us all wary of fellow human beings.how can one establish one's identity.witnesses can be conjured up ,records and passports can be faked. then how???If u have enjoyed Panther Panchali the movie plz plz read the book.The writer Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhay was a philosophical penner and his novels are like Joyce's work with rich shades of emotions and no perceptible actions.u will luv the book.i am not sure if there are English standard versions available.I and some frnds are trying to translate.contact me 2 know about progress.Aranyak or the forest saga is the writers favorite book where he explores man's relationship with nature.Rich in Imagery like Thomas Hardy. his only action book 'Chander Paahar '(Mountain of the Moon) is about a young bengali boy Shankar's adventure in the Richtersveld mountains of Africa with a gold prospector Portugeese called Diego Alvarez.A stunning children's classic with suspense and inspiration.comparable 2 the Moby Dick.regards 2 allRomit\",\"217\":\"It is so rare to be so lost within a movie and it's world during a viewing that it's an outright privilege to get to watch Pather Panchali.

Pather Panchali is a demonstration of what a movie can actually be, of how great a film can be. I don't feel that I can overhype this film at all.

More people would rather talk about this film than watch it carefully. The film misses the \\\"Ballali Balai\\\" part of the novel by Bibhutibhushan which is a must read for a complete picture of the background of the film. Bibhuti's novel consists of three parts, a) Ballali Balai, b) Aam anti-r bhnepu, c) Akrura Sangbad. Ray covers Aam aanti-r bhnepu in \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" film and the \\\"AKrur Sangbad\\\" deals with the first half of \\\"Aparajito\\\" which ends with Harihara's death.\",\"222\":\"\\\"Not having seen Ray's films is like not having seen the Sun and the moon\\\", said Akira Kurosawa, the famous Japanese director and an ambassador of Indo-Japanese relations along with Satyajit Ray. Kurosawa wasn't flattering Ray when he opined this. There is no tinge of contempt in this praise to those who haven't seen Ray's films, or the Sun and the moon, for that matter. There is only the assertion that Ray's films are a sign of life, much like the Sun and the moon. That the rise and set of the Sun and the moon are an internalized experience in humans, and so are the ideas of Ray's films, even if one hasn't taken notice of either. Pather Panchali is a reminder that all who have seen the Sun and the moon can be familiar with the film, for that is the only qualification needed.This is illustrated in one of the many wonderful scenes of the film, the famous train chase. Apu chased Durga into a Kaash Blossom field. He chased her because she teased him. She teased him because he caused her getting a scolding from their mother. Their mother scolded Durga because Durga was hitting Apu. And Durga was hitting Apu because he wore a crown out of her box of personal belongings. How very sibling! Durga beckoned him to sit down with her under the tall, fluffy grass flowers, both forgetting the quarrel. The sound of a train's engine roared. This callback to their yearning to see a running train, earlier in the film, does wonders to their character arcs. However, the astonishment of this writer didn't end there. While Apu and Durga began to run after the train, the camera cut to the other side of the train tracks and tracked them from between the wheels of the train. On the first viewing, this writer was exhilarated at the scene. A sheer excitement ran along with Apu, Durga and the camera. Watching a train run was so terrific, for a 21st century viewer!Whereas the second viewing of the same scene, not long after the first, was very different. The sound of the running train was calming. The wind that blew through the Kaash fields was calming. The black smoke from the train, left behind in the large sky, was calming. The scene brought a fulfillment at its ends and was more about the completion of this plot thread of the characters, than about the callback. What remained common in both viewings was the force of life. The train was a juggernaut and Apu and Durga, two beams of passion. The constant throughout the scene was a human yearning and a chase for that yearning. But what intrigues this writer furthermore is how the scene will feel on further viewings. The scene full of life.Along with the affinity of Apu and Durga, Karuna Banerjee as Sarbojaya shares her sorrow with the camera. Her eyes and expressions are enough to tell her story. The story of plenty of women who live under weak roofs, crippled due to debt and poverty. Women left with such little potential in the four walls of their home, all they remain capable of is tending after the children and worrying. Women who are helpless of their own haplessness. Whose eyes are a sum total of their grief and happiness, but mostly grief. In a very pensive shot towards the end of the film, Apu stared into the distance while brushing his gums. There is the realisation that he has his mother's eyes. And his eyes and face began to tell the same story as his mother's did. This child had witnessed death, twice. He was getting acquainted to growth and the accompanying grief. The last glimpse of his boyish charisma comes further in the last minutes of the film. The Ray family was packing to leave Nishindipur and Apu came across Durga's box again. He found that Didi had, infact, stolen the beaded necklace, of which the neighbouring woman had alleged her. He threw it into the lake. Not to relieve himself and everyone else of the last memory of Durga, not to complete another plot thread and character arc, but in a simple effort to not be caught.Renowned film critic Roger Ebert once said, \\\"The problem with a film that is ten years old is that it isn't thirty years old.\\\" The time periods aren't absolute, but his message is. The life of a film is a test of time. A newly released film has the perfect era and audience for its release. Ten years later, it may still continue to have a resurgence when the next generation of moviegoers rediscover it. It might still prevail under the habitats of its original release, if such habitats remain. At this point, it's still not certain whether the film will live on or not. But a film that is thirty years old would be devoid of the era it was created in and the audience it was created for. When the movie-going audience revisits such a film, the film might become timeless, if it still receives the acclaim. Or it may become dated. Pather Panchali and Ray's other films are the Sun and moon of cinema. And as long as we can see the Sun and moon, we will fall in love with Ray's films, generation after generation.\",\"223\":\"I have just finished Pather Panchali. To be honest, it took almost two weeks to watch it. Not only interruptions, but the shear poverty of the individuals--the family--is overwhelming. Each member exhibits their poverty and destitution in a different way. My favorite character is Durga, who gives and gives until she reaches the point where she is tired of not receiving.I will forever remember this movie, and I hope to watch the other two parts of the trilogy.I have to have this film in my collection. Movies that make you think and think again, and search your heart for answers that sometimes never come.\",\"224\":\"On watching this masterpiece of Indian cinema, I was left disgusted with the rest of the Indian Film Industry, especially those self-indulgent asses in Mumbai. This is what film-making is all about. This is the power of cinema. This is a movie SRK, Aamir, Amitabh, Karan Johar, Rani Mukherji, Ash and all those idiots would never understand and don't even think that they would make it. With Nayakan and if one can exclude the pomp, Lagaan, this is the creme-de-la-creme of Indian, nay, Asian, No, World Cinema! A masterpiece. Technically brilliant, artistically outstanding and a movie our stupid audience and even stupider film industry can never appreciate and understand, thus it must contend with praise from phirangis.\",\"225\":\"No glitz no glamour just pure cinema .Love it\\n.It explores human relation unlike any other film .\",\"226\":\"I was shocked when I saw Pather Panchali.\\nFirst, because it has a beautiful contrast in black and white.

Wonderful photography by cinematographer Subrata Mitra.\\nSecond, the pace of the film. You follow and feel inside that village and wait for what will happen.

One of the best films I've ever seen.\",\"227\":\"Best movie of Satyajit Ray , I have ever seen\\nWhen I was in 10th class I studied about the Satyajit ray in our English book\\nThe pather panchaali is the best ever movie I have ever seen\",\"228\":\"This film is based on the the Bengali novel \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. It is hard to believe Satyajit Ray made his directorial debut with this film. The movie itself is the evidence what Satyajit Ray was capable of. Story is simple but the things that make the film great are its soulful scenes without using dialogues, camera work technically very much ahead of its time and the background score by Pandit Ravi Shankar setting the tone for the movie. The style of detailings used in this film help us to connect with the film. Cinematography and believable acting are the strength of this film. No wonder why Martin Scorsese was a great admirer of Satyajit Ray's work.\",\"229\":\"This is an intense movie. It smells of earth after a sudden downpour in mid-summer. Unexpected, slightly uncomfortable yet devinely inspired. There is subtle poetry of emotions underlying the movie. The characters are honest and very human. The best part of the movie is the Camera work considering the movie was made in 1955. Overall comfort food for mind, though I would not recommend it as a first date movie.\",\"230\":\"Growing up in India I had heard of this movie as one of Satyajit Ray's classics and a movie which showed the utter poverty of rural India. Anything classic used to evoke a feeling of a movie usually boring and worse it's most likely would be a black and white film lamenting on the sorry state of human affairs. Of course those were the childhood metrics to gauge what a good film should be and thankfully I have outgrown those notions. Nevertheless I wanted to watch this movie when Satyajit Ray died in 1992 and once again media was talking about his movies. But somehow I didn't have access to this movie anywhere (those days of VHS tapes).I watched this movie recently and was in a stunned mode throughout the span of movie. What an emotional roller coaster ride this had been and it has been done without even making you feel that it's a movie, it's just seems real life happening in front of your eyes. I don't want to describe much the story here(as other have already commented much) but more of what I felt watching (re-watching)this movie. The beautiful and poetic flow of this movie is so smooth that you sort of start living the life as depicted. This movie conveys the reality of hard life but with such gracefulness that you don't feel utterly bad or depressed rather you start contemplating about your existence and the beauty in such mundane things that we tend to ignore. This film gives you the moment, the pause, that forces you to reflect on the meaning of life. There were many moments in the film which touched the heart in many ways: - Durga and Apu's longing for sweets and following the \\\"misty kaka\\\" (candy man) in hope. - Old Aunt's happiness on such small things as getting a stolen fruit, couple of stolen chillies, etc. - Mom's inner strength on managing on in a hopeless situation and shattering of it with Durga's death. - Father's wail on hearing the fate of Durga... - Apu's instinctive hiding of the truth about Durga's theft.I am fascinated and surely will watch the other two movies in the trilogy...\",\"231\":\"Ray's Pather Panchali is a document of unbridled realism which explores the life of a Bengali family in their struggles with the harsh conditions of early 20 th century India. Existing in an infinate desert of mainstream 'in your face' hollywood cinema, I found this film a wonderful oasis. I do admit that this film moves very slow and I did initially struggle with this. However, its slow pace allows one to \\\"slow down\\\" and explore the richness of Ray's portrayl of symbolism and quiet desparation. In the recent North American curiousity of Bollywood films, Pather Panchali is NOT this. Rather, this film is a  genuine masterpiece that will be treasured for generations.\",\"232\":\"First and foremost thing is that u need to have taste. A taste for movies which doesn't show an incredible or cheap story lines, but which are beautiful snapshots with each scene depicting its own saga.'Pather Panchali'(song of the little road) is one of such movie. It's a 'kaaljai' (one which is not bounded by space and time) piece of art.Though some people will find it fragmented, but the truth is that Ray has worked on each and every scene. Some scenes are historical like 'rain shower' and 'the vessel floating'. Surely Ray is the Shakespeare of Indian cinema, who loves to develop the characters. Though the movie dates back to late 50s still you can find traces of the 21st century's society (Indian) and the universal behavior of human. Bound in the ties of selfishness, ego, our own problems and society often the behavior of human is quite disgustful. But when it comes the time of crisis our true heart is revealed which is loaded with love and is hungry for it. The climax really highlights this notion in a beautiful way. Secondly, Ray seems to be well acquainted with the importance of family. And the selfless love among family members is the part and parcel of the movie.The innocence of Apu and Durga, brother-sister love, humanity, mother's care, relation between Durga and her aunt and (of course) the miseries and songs of the aunt had made the movie eternal. About the acting, I'll say that Chunibala Devi (Indir Thakrun) is the person who suppresses all other great performances. From her scene first to the very end she seems to steal all the scenes. I would call this one of great Indian performance. Uma Das Gupta has very well presented the character of Durga (I personally find her most amusing part of the movie). Both she and Subeer Banerjee (Apu) had presented their innocence quite artfully. There are some songs in the movie which in spite of being in Bengali (incomprehensible for many people and me) flow with the movie. Perhaps I might be wrong but they (songs) don't satisfy as such. At last, if you still had had no opportunity to watch this classic then I would personally recommend it to you, but with two precautions:First watch it if you really have taste buds for such art films (as I already have said). And second the film is of 50s so prepare your mind for a slow and no larger than life or exciting events in the story (it is quite realistic)If you are mentally prepare then don't wait just fetch it anyhow and see the 'weird beauty' of your own world through a genius' eye\\u00c2\\u2026..\",\"233\":\"first time i m feeling little weirdo...when i am writing a review about this movie.. me thinking if i am capable of throwing review to Mr ray but total respect for sir Satyajit ray..so when my wacky cinematic train arrives at Satyajit Ray poetic writer's narration platform.. giving me some nappy shocks it try to cover you in cinema power.. i am impressed by Satyajit special moments he creates by his creative work...slapping the old Indian society politely as well as truly showing the joy of kid struggling but still enjoying with his innocence...the framework connects the basic of cinema...some calls it slow i call it smooth..zooming in and out to shows emotional zone...perfect touchy... i am against who talk about his camera-work.. capturing nature in camera gives rhyme scheme to poetic story he narrate...i have followed french new wave cinema and Italian cinema before i came to know about Satyajit ray.. it was recommend by some french director.. my ride throw Bengali Satyajit ray movie was equally good as french..he knows how to justify the beautiful written characters . he succeeded in melting some stone heart for sure by beauty of relations n cover genres of emotions.. i loved the character Thakurji (aunt) and Apu the most ..they took me some cloudy wave experience.. only thing i hated about the movie was i watched it late... still i cut two points because of acting ..and less involvement of crew...\",\"234\":\"Rating it 10\\/10, or rating scale is useless to tell how great this work is!Overwhelming. Eloquent. Deep. People say this movie as a Indian version of Bicycle Thieves. But I would say this is more than that, very different and captures the emotions in the extremities of life, everything feels so real that one could imagine about (something similar as in Premchand's Godaan novel). This is the first movie of Satyajit Ray I have watched yet, and I must watch all of his lifelong work. And this feeling indulges my mind to read Bibhutibhushan Bandopadhyay's original novel.Superb acting by every character, so strong, so real! Still camera, use of natural lights and shadows, makes you think how intelligent was the mind behind it. Sensitive story plot, and attention to every minute detail is phenomenal.This movie is a remarkable and classic story which tells both how beautiful and worst is life in very bad and in extremely bad situations, and flows in different ages as time passes.I can watch it for tens of times if I could make time for it!As a note, Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon Movie is not so different, but Pather Panchali feels at home and heart touching.A recommended one for classical movie lovers.\",\"235\":\"Calling Satyajit Ray a genius is a mere understatement. Can someone believe that Pather Panchali is a debut for this creator? Pather Panchali, is truly a remarkable masterpiece that is carved with brilliant film making. It leaves us awestruck and scene by scene is a sculpture. I do not recollect when was the last time that I watched an Indian film that portrays reality to this extent. It's been almost 60 years since the release of Pather Panchali but no other movie can inch closer to this marvel. Epic performance from the entire cast. Editing was top notch, so was the cinematography. If you want to become a film maker, you don't have to go to a film school, just watch the trilogy. This movie is very precious for the Indian cinema and will be cherished forever.\",\"236\":\"I watched the remastered Version. The image quality is very good. This movie shows some very remarkable characters one would not see a lot in Western movies.The life of an ordinary family of lower social status with all facets of life. I liked it a lot!\",\"237\":\"The film is certainly a masterpiece. The film is overwhelmingly real and the key element in the movie is the maintenance of this realism. The characters are so true to the ethnic rural-sixties Indian existence that one is compelled to wonder if the film was captured through surveillance cameras. Pather Panchali, released in 1955, is the first film of director Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. The film is a serene and beautiful depiction of a little boy's childhood in the Indian countryside in the 1950s.The film was made on a shoestring budget by a hitherto unknown director. Apart from a seventy-year-old woman who made her name in the 1930s on the stage, none of the cast had ever acted before and many had been plucked from the Indian rurality. In contrast Satyajit Ray completed the trilogy on the behest of the Indian Prime Minister, pointing to the film's cultural impact.It's a quiet, simple tale, centering on the life of a small family living in a rural village in Bengal. The father, Harihar (Kanu Bannerjee), is a priest and poet who cares more about his writing and spiritual welfare than obtaining wages he is owed. The mother, Sarbojaya (Karuna Bannerjee), worries that her husband's financial laxity will leave her without enough food for her two children, daughter Durga (Uma Das Gupta) and son Apu (Subir Bannerjee). Harihar's family often lives on the edge of poverty, coping with the unkind taunts of their neighbors, the burden of caring for an aging aunt (Chunibala Devi), and the terrible aftermath of a natural catastrophe.Most of what transpires is shown through the eyes of either Sarbojaya or Durga, and, as a result, we identify most closely with these two. Harihar is absent for more than half of the movie, and, before the penultimate scene, Apu is a mere witness to events, rather than a participant. Until the closing moments, we don't get a sense of the young boy as a fully formed individual, since he's always in someone else's shadow. The simple story of the Bengali family will definitely stay in my heart for a long time to come. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?........\",\"238\":\"Directed by: Satyajit Ray\\nThe realist narrative style of \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" was influenced by Italian neorealism and the works of French director Jean Renoir.\\nThe story deals with ; A poor Brahmin family in rural Bengal, India in the 1920s deals with life's struggles but the two children, Durga and Apu, manage to find joy in the simplest things.\\nDirector Satyajit Ray keeps a very smooth and gentle flow moving in this film. Even the smallest of situations can be made to be eventful. His camera helps us to experience the beauty of such things as a wind blowing against a field or lifting lily pads in a river.

These are among the most beautiful, richly human movies ever made-essential works for any film lover. It would move even the most still of hearts, the impact is felt well after the film's conclusion. One powerful technique Ray uses is to have the camera on the faces of two people simultaneously where one is aware of the shocking event while the other is blissfully ignorant.\",\"239\":\"This is a film popular the world over amongst film scholars as a 'World Cinema' masterpiece. For various reasons it is most definitely that - a masterpiece.Ray started making this film in 1950 and finally completed it in '54. The problem? Lack of a financial backer. The reasons for this were two: 1)Ray was an unknown in the film-making business and 2)his ideas for the film were deemed unworkable in terms of catering to a paying audience. However, Ray persevered and managed to obtain the financing from the local West Bengal Govt. and in the process changed the face of Indian cinema forever (and it needed some changing too).This is a miraculous film if one is to look at what had preceded it in India and most of what has come after. It is sensitive to the ambiance of rural Bengal (which is brought out oh so beautifully by the graceful photography and the musical score of Ravi Shankar) and it is - unlike most Indian cinema - honest and tender to its rustic characters without a shade of any patronising or exploitative element. The result is a beautiful, warm, languid film that truly captures the essence of village life in Bengal in a celluloid form that any movie-goer the world over will be able to not only appreciate, but more importantly, love.The acting is stunning considering a lot of non-actors were used here - a la De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief', an inspiration according to Ray. I must mention the lady who plays Chunibala - you will not find a role better executed in cinema. A prostitute in her younger days, Ray tracked her down at the local Red Light District where she was living with her daughter. Ray was always an expert at picking the right man for the role and then prodding them along till they produced near-perfect performances on screen and this film is no different.This is a landmark film for Indian cinema in so many ways - the first time in India that shooting happened almost entirely outdoors, the first time someone with any knowledge of the film medium and film-making the world over handled a camera, the first time that actors acted naturally instead of the melodrama-infused performances that were and still are the norm in Indian cinema. Keeping everything surrounding the film in mind, and then watching the film for the beautiful journey that it is - makes you realise just how immense this work is. A remarkable tour-de-force. A triumph of cinema in a truly hostile environment for intelligent film-making.\",\"240\":\"Satyajit Ray Is a very talented director...\\nThis film show the Culture of Bengal. And Poverty of Bengal people... It Show the love between brother and sister love between Mother , father and Children..\\nAnd What a Direction level of Situations Ray.\\nOver All it's Great film.... Every people must Show this film minimum 1 time..\",\"241\":\"Probably, the most palpable flow of the story on the celluloid. The most lasting facet of the film is the universality of its expression and the its capability to make the linguistic boundaries meaningless. Never ever one feels that one is watching a film as it is so real in terms of the performances and directorial ability of Ray.\",\"242\":\"\\\"Pather Panchali\\\", Satyajit Ray's debut film about life in a Bengali village, was the first movie from India to gain wide recognition and acclaim in the west. It is an affecting story of a rural family struggling to deal with poverty and tragedy in their ancestral home. Ray adapted the script from Bibhuti Bihushaw Banerjee's semi-autobiographical novel of the same title and retells it with natural beauty and a quiet perspective. The filmmaker, who came from a literary and artistic background(He was a product of the Indian Renaissance) was interested in the contemporary problems of his country-and he shared with the Neorealist films from Italy- a simple and direct approach to making movies. Ray created ordinary scenes that were incredibly life-like. His films contained very few strains of artifice. He believed that the raw material of cinema was life itself. Ray generally concentrated on small subjects and ordinary people. He favored using non-actors and shooting on location to heighten the realism. He made films in his own style; dignified and subtle; sincere and with a conscience. In \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" (Song of the Little Road\\\") Ray makes superb use of his milieu. The viewer immediately feels the cramped conditions of the families' decaying house and the open-air confines of the surrounding forest. When Ray sends his camera beyond the village, the observer can sense the allure and freedom of the vast fields that spring immodestly from a thin, winding trail. Rays' was a cinema of thought and feeling, in which emotion was deliberately restrained because it is so strong. This restraint adds to the psychological intensity in his work. Nearly all of his films are marked by this remarkable depth of feeling. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\", the first installment of the Apu Trilogy(\\\"Aparajito\\\" and \\\"The World of Apu\\\" would follow) depicts a young boy (Apu) exploring his ever-expanding universe with a growing sense of wonder. Ray excelled at showing how children and adolescents confront mystery and joy; sadness and death. The director shows Apu's burgeoning awareness with a masterful use of the long shot. High-angled, distant shots track Apu and his older sister Durga, as they run spiritedly through white-kashed fields. This sense of discovery gives the film it's emotional power. The director's main subject was India-it's customs and culture. It's conflicts between the traditional way of life and the impact and influence of the West. He tried arduously to capture this synthesis between western ideas and traditional Hindu values. His concern for human problems and not issues of national politics gave his films universal appeal. \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" delineates the small joys and acute sorrows of a poor Indian family. It is an endearing testament that poverty does not nullify love and that even the most afflicted person can find some modest pleasures in their world. The film's indigenous sound track is vital to Ray's story of ancestral limitations. Twanging ektaras, wailing tarshehnais and six-stringed sitars resound liberally throughout the movie. It would be difficult to imagine \\\"Pather Panchali\\\" without it's memorable score. Satyajit Ray was an unpretentious filmmaker. He was genuinely uninterested in commercial considerations. His films were life-affirming, authentic and honest; gentle and poetic- truthful observations on human behavior that employed simple but strong themes. Ray's unadorned style of film-making was intimate, probing, and revealing. (Possible spoiler) The final scene shows the grieving family leaving their home in an ox-driven carriage to begin a new life. A trailing camera in medium close-up captures a compelling mixture of emotions on their faces. Expressions of pain and resolution; hope and despair; the future and the past. A seemingly simple yet unmistakably powerful scene that typifies Satyajit Ray's profound cinema. A cinema of gentle but deep observation, understanding and unabashed love of the human race.\",\"243\":\"This movie is one of my favorite movie ever.seriously I was upset while watching the movie because I thought that if I went back to this place and shared my love with them.what simplicity is carried out,its clearly understand.\\nmusic,dialouge,drama all were properly balanced.if you watch the movie you must think that 'seriously I have been aparting from nature!'\",\"244\":\"An outstanding representation of life as we know it .No fantasy , no outlandish events , just pure realism at its best .\",\"245\":\"This is the first film to blend poverty and neo realism into an emotional ride .We follow the life of a common ordinary man from rural india on his journey of life ..... and death of everyone who loves him .\",\"246\":\"1955...........2020 S Decade.

This is a staple of my video library, along with Ray's other two films which complete the trio, \\\"Aparajito\\\" and \\\"The World of Apu.\\\" I have watched the trilogy in a continuous sitting on two occasions, and the experience was emotionally overwhelming.\",\"250\":\"Panther pachali is the best movie of the world,and it's simplicity makes it that\",\"251\":\"The movie 'Panther Panchali' is the best movie I have ever seen in Indian film industry and also one of the prolific one in the International film industry. Panther Panchali describes the world from the view point of a young child with dreams, imagination, interpretation of the world around him and his encounters with reality through the characters around him and the surrounding. This makes the movie a well balanced mixture of revelations of realism and the imagery interpretation of that realism through the mind and eyes of a young child Apu. This very fact also provides the film with a simplicity and flow that is very striking while at the same time bringing out the hopes and sadness, happiness and struggle of a newly emergent nation, primarily rural society based, still struggling and striving to raise itself to a higher level. It is reality interspersed and woven through imagination and hope, the striving for a betterment, the eternal flow of the path of life through hopes and struggle of a common Indian poverty stricken rural family which is the striking reality of a nascent nation where even today more than 70% of the population live and die in the same abject poverty yet resilient enough to hope and endeavor for amelioration of their social status, a better life. This hope for better future has been nicely portrayed at the end of the movie when the whole family move out of the village in search of a better life in the city in-spite of their losses and uncertainties. The whole movie has a poetry like characteristics in its unfolding of the realism woven through imagination of a young boy and his striking encounters with the real world and its malaise through incidents like the death of his sister with whom he shared a very sweet relationship, his revelation of the theft of his sister after her death and the though that flows through his mind and his act of throwing the same in the pond in an attempt to consciously deny and forget the negativity in his beloved world surrounding him, his first encounter with the modern world of steam engine and trains, etc. The skillful screenplay and the wonderful musical tune in the movie has definitely helped in bringing out the central flow of the incidents and the inner meaning of the movie. It is eternal in nature and not really confined to a particular family, time or place, it brings out the very real and everyday story of millions in similar surroundings in Indian society. This is a movie which leaves you thinking and filled sweet and melancholy emotions after you have finished watching. This movie stands out for the very fact that it brings out the striking harsh reality in a sweet and nice manner like a poetry, a musical tune, the tune of life of millions.\",\"252\":\"This movie is one of the great movies ever made.

Besides how great the film is, it also has a profound cultural importance in the backdrop and Bengal and India.\",\"254\":\"A stripped down approach at showing what the human life actually is. Ray's debut film Pather Panchali was a monumental success as this film introduced the world to Indian Cinema.The film deals with the life of the a family of five, and we see how this family experience the toughest of situations and still find a way to live. Durga & Apu are the two siblings that are mainly the focus in here, as their father leaves to some other state for work. They are often accused of stealing by the landlord's wife but nonetheless the kids are loved by all.The story of the film is rather very simple as we see the birth of Apu & how despite being the main focus he doesn't do anything significant in this film. He just observes whatever is happening in his surroundings. The events flow like river and the period of days turn into weeks, weeks into months and months into year without any indication to the viewers. There's nothing philosophical discussed in the film but the theme of life and how can it be so cruel at times has been portrayed beautifully. The theme of society, how little they think of other people's sufferings and wait until something great trauma occurs. The bonding between Apu & Durga, their conversations, their dreams and all of their hopes are portrayed beautifully with dialogues that doesn't seem too heavy but still has lots of depth to think upon.Pather Panchali is a near perfect film. It excels in each and every aspect a film should be based. The character build-up which would become Ray's main strength in his subsequent films has clearly laid the foundation in this film. While watching we feel like we know apu, durga, and all of her family for a significant amount of time. The music composition by Pt. Ravi Shankar, is phenomenal and the way that it seemingly blends with the emotions of characters.The simplicity and minimalism with which Ray has made this film, remains unparalleled to this day.\",\"255\":\"The world the films shows us is an epitome of artistry in filmmaking, it is indeed one of the few films that can actually be acknowledged with the 'each frame, a painting!' phrase. Realism takes new unseen heights in the film with it's artists, be it Appu, Durga, their mother or the old woman who effortlessly sweeps us off from all our assumptions on acting and actors. Despite all this I think the greatest strength of this movie is it's 'timelessness' I haven't seen any film from the 50s or even the 'Hitchcock'ian 60s that are as timeless as Pather Panchali. This fact that the film stays authentic and relevant in all aspects even today in 2021 is something that we all need to be experience and wonder !\",\"256\":\"The music. The sounds. The pictures. The feelings. Everything is so pure.\",\"257\":\"The most moving and personal experiencefrom start to finish.\",\"258\":\"Films like Pather Panchali tend to be a bit of a slog for me. With a 2+ hour run time and a slew of cultural and generational barriers, I know that a more complete understanding of the true nature of the story is just out of my grasp.With that said, Satyajit Ray is able to pull together an almost entirely amateur crew, himself included, to adapt a story that is both sincere and engrossing. The ability of Pather Panchali to highlight life's small joys in the midst of pain and suffering sets it apart from its contemporaries. I just wish that they were nicer to cats in early 1900s rural Bengal.\",\"259\":\"Very much a product of its time but only of its time. Love the gov advisory notices before the feature about how smoking and alcohol are bad for you but the score for 'Song of the little road' got on my nerves pretty quickly after that. I found the whole affair tedious. If you want to see a decent bildungsroman check out 'Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter & Spring', far superior.\",\"260\":\"PATHER PANCHILI directed by none other than the great film director Satyajit Roy based on the novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay. It begins in a roral bengali village where a priest & his wife struggle to raise their daughter and young son Apu.

It is the frist part of APu Trilogy wich is also considered one of the greatest flim trilogies.The flim is a true example of presenting humantity.its beautifully portraited rurel life and the parils and pitfalls of poverty. Ray shows the world through the innocent eyes of his protagonist Apu. The family edges closer to financial rainbut Apus eyes are full of dreams. The characterization in the screenplay reduces the pace of the flim quit a bit, but it is a technique to engages the audience .For me, the most moving character was the ancient aunt who is waiting to die but wishing to live every day fully.Form my point of view,this flim is so simple yet so complex in emotion.its competenty made through realism ,poetric,& beautiful in its simplicty. This is a movie that leaves you filled sweet and melanchoy emotions after you have finished watching.\",\"261\":\"True art transcends its medium.  Like being connected to a higher spirit of life.  God bless you Satyajit Ray.  The reason I became a film maker.  The essential element here is, I think, humility.  Humility in the eyes of one's fellow man, in the eyes of a higher common spirit. Puts to shame the common ego on display by most directors. Ray puts his characters, their story, their humanity before all else. This is what the great art of film making is for, and what it can teach us all.  A film of a pure and great love.\",\"262\":\"Pather panchali....perhaps,the greatest film the world ever seen.It's a powerful film which portrays the Indian culture.When i saw this film for the first time, i couldn't speak for a moment....It's a first film by legendary satyajit ray..the way he directed the movie was just incredible. Great cinematography by subrata mitra..A scene involving candy seller is just amazing.what i really like about this film is...the performance given by the old aunt..i think she was some 80 years old when she did this role..i think the credit should go to Ray.I've never seen a film like that before...i salute Ray for his outstanding work..\",\"263\":\"I can't believe I waited so long to watch this movie. I recently rented it on Google Movies with some credits I had, half-way into the movie and I regretted my decision to have not purchased it outright. This is not just a movie it is an event in cinematic history you have to experience. You feel an unreal connection with all the characters and they linger with you long after the end credits. I don't know if this movie will ever leave me, I certainly hope not. I understand now why they call Satyajit Raj one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. All the actors have acted amazingly for being amateurs. I simply cannot forget Durga or the old aunt, Indir Thakrun. Chunibala Devi, who plays the aging aunt delivers one of the best performances I have ever seen. Watch this movie and let it sink in. You will simply be unable to comprehend all the different emotions you encounter throughout its run time.I will wait some time before watching the rest of the trilogy. This is way too much for me right now.\",\"264\":\"it's hard to describe the feelings about pather panchali as u find hard to describe ur emotional feelings; it's simply superb; one of the perfectly made film ever; with such rhythmic flow; precisely chosen dialogues and overall a classic background music by Ravi shankar, the genius.And u have to keep it in your mind this film was made without any modern technical help; not even to the standard at that time.The eternal family relations and bonding are beautifully portrayed by Ray in this masterpiece. I think this is the best narrative film ever produced touching the true values of humanity and emotion.Salute to the master. All the Ray lovers should watch his other classics like rest of Apu Trilogy, Jalshaghar(the music room). Nayak,Charulata,mahanagar...\",\"265\":\"Watching the Trilogy of Apu is an incredible experience, it makes you wonder how could ray describe happiness, despair and love in such a powerful way in movies where not much happen. This is pure poetry accompanied by the most wonderful music of Ravi Shankar. It is not by chance that some scenes from the movies of Shankar became a ever-classic... they are memorable.\",\"266\":\"Pather Panchali, The directorial debut of Satyajit Ray. The movie is all an emotional roller-coaster ride. Its just like you are flowing against a river of emotions. You never know what's ahead. The movie is a matter of pride for every Indian. This movie is a major landmark of Indian and World Cinema.Talking about characters. Characters were defined with such depth and scope. Each character has its own uniqueness. The old aunt and Apu were outstanding. The old aunt played by Chunibala Devi acted out very well. Every actor just brings out the realism in the story. I think watching Apu and Durga brought out immense joy in me. Durga stealing Guava and the happiness in old aunt when Durga gifts it to her.The role of music in this movie. Movie is not about visual treat by Ray but a collection of melodious tunes by Pandit Ravishankar. Every frame in the movie is backed up by a background score suiting the ambiance and mood at that instant. I guess the score added to the beauty of the movie. For instance the scene where Durga and Apu are drenched in rain. The music played a great role in giving the warmth to the visuals.Apart from story and music, Ray's visuals attracted me mainly. A perfect visual treat. The cinematography is stunning and apt to the theme of the movie. It never failed the ambiance or feel of the movie, Lyrical maybe. I loved the scene where a cat cuddles by a dog. Likewise, old aunt showing the hole in her blanket. Apu finding the necklace Durga stole. Perfect.As Akira Kurosawa said of him:\\\"To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun\\\"\",\"267\":\"A deeply emotional story exploring human nature (particularly its weakness), family ties\\/disconnections and karma which is really well told despite being slow and meandering at times. Black and white definitely adds something to the film. One of the best things about this film is that the interpretation is left up to you - just like life. I get the feeling my empathy will change from one character to another depending on my viewpoint of life. On this occasion I focused on the mother, her isolation, susceptibility to the opinions of others and how this distorted and transformed her intense love for her family into something wicked and ugly. I have huge admiration for the character insight provided by the director always shying away from telling the audience what to think or how to interpret it. Still puzzled by the long scene showing dragonflies and lilies on the pond. It was waaaaaaaay too long. Also the religious references were lost on me.\",\"268\":\"There are movies that you watch and forget even if they were good and then there are some that linger on for some strange reason. This, as expected, was one of those very few.The technical quality can be discounted completely as it was made in the '50s and on a shoestring budget but, what really stands out, is the quality of the content per every minute that the film rolls.... Unbelievable!!! The message that is conveyed is universal and the subtlety is remarkable. I am not saying this because I am from India but for the fact that Ray was as brilliant universally as Bergman and the likes.Watch it with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.\",\"269\":\"One of the most beautiful films from one of the most important directors of this era.First and foremost thing is that u need to have taste. A taste for movies which doesn't show an incredible or cheap story lines, but which are beautiful snapshots with each scene depicting its own saga.'Pather Panchali'(song of the little road) is one of such movie. It's a 'kaaljai' (one which is not bounded by space and time) piece of art.Though some people will find it fragmented, but the truth is that Ray has worked on each and every scene. Some scenes are historical like 'rain shower' and 'the vessel floating'. Surely Ray is the Shakespeare of Indian cinema, who loves to develop the characters. Though the movie dates back to late 50s still you can find traces of the 21st century's society (Indian) and the universal behavior of human. Bound in the ties of selfishness, ego, our own problems and society often the behavior of human is quite disgustful. But when it comes the time of crisis our true heart is revealed which is loaded with love and is hungry for it. The climax really highlights this notion in a beautiful way. Secondly, Ray seems to be well acquainted with the importance of family. And the selfless love among family members is the part and parcel of the movie.The innocence of Apu and Durga, brother-sister love, humanity, mother's care, relation between Durga and her aunt and (of course) the miseries and songs of the aunt had made the movie eternal. About the acting, I'll say that Chunibala Devi (Indir Thakrun) is the person who suppresses all other great performances. From her scene first to the very end she seems to steal all the scenes. I would call this one of great Indian performance. Uma Das Gupta has very well presented the character of Durga (I personally find her most amusing part of the movie). Both she and Subeer Banerjee (Apu) had presented their innocence quite artfully. There are some songs in the movie which in spite of being in Bengali (incomprehensible for many people and me) flow with the movie. Perhaps I might be wrong but they (songs) don't satisfy as such. At last, if you still had had no opportunity to watch this classic then I would personally recommend it to you, but with two precautions:First watch it if you really have taste buds for such art films (as I already have said).And second the film is of 50s so prepare your mind for a slow and no larger than life or exciting events in the story (it is quite realistic)If you are mentally prepare then don't wait just fetch it anyhow and see the 'weird beauty' of your own world through a genius' eye\",\"270\":\"I don't know how even 6.4% of the female voters could have given this movie a 2!!!!! This was Ray's first movie, but his economy of dialog, his synchronization and sympathy with India's rural life is incredible. So little said, yet so much! Apu and Durga following the sweetmeat seller, the scene where they run through a \\\"kash\\\" field....superb, the work of a real artist, a master. The film develops its characters and the atmosphere slowly and resolutely. The narrative builds up to a powerful climax. Ray had an ancient camera while shooting this movie, did it matter? No. His expression and technique was more than sound, although this was a maiden venture. Some critics found(and still find, I might add) the film to be too slow. Satyajit Ray wrote about the slow pace - \\\"The cinematic material dictated a style to me, a very slow rhythm determined by nature, the landscape, the country. The script had to retain some of the rambling quality of the novel because that in itself contained a clue to the authenticity: life in a poor Bengali village does ramble.\\\"There you are, if you have not watched this movie, you'll probably missed the greatest movie made on Indian rural life. That's why Akira Kurosawa said of him:\\\"To have not seen the films of Ray is to have lived in the world without ever having seen the moon and the sun\\\"\",\"271\":\"Pather Panchali is a very true film by a great director Satyajit Ray.Its a wonder that a director of this caliber stayed mostly in India making film which made the audience laugh,cry and agonize over as well as feel the presence of a great film making.The film based on Bhibutibhushan's novel tells the story of Apu a Bengali boy in the non independent India.He struggles to earn his food and see the happiness of family.The poverty ridden people couldn't even afford their food.A old woman who was criticized by Apu's mother often visualizes the pain of living a tenant.Meanwhile Apu's father Subrata dies leaving problems of livelihood.Apu departs silently.A wonderful experience to be enjoyed by whole family.\",\"272\":\"...it is one of those greatest works of art..so lyrical yet so composed. there is one phrase that Ray has used extensively in his writings; something that his professor use to say when he was studying painting in Shantiniketan: \\\"look at Fujiyama, Fire within and Calm without. There is the symbol of true oriental artist...\\\" i think it best describes Ray's work where he suggests in his cinema enormous reserves of power and feelings which never spill into emotional displays.the strength and variety of the cinematic craftsmanship in this film can be explored endlessly, but what strikes me the most, is the way his work has confirmed, sustained and nurtured the existence of an art form, western in origin, transplanted and taking root in Indian soil. in a way pather panchali is so 'rooted'. it is so earthy and 'regional' at core and may be thats why its 'international', may be thats why, despite being the product of its time and place it is universal in its appeal. the moods and moments that he creates are simply 'matchless'. so simple, and yet so profound. the Indir Thakuran sequences of the film remain for me the highest, noblest and rare expression of art in Indian films so far (except films by Ghatak and Mrinal Sen) The film induces a kind of contemplation and a sense of wonder, about the truth, individual and privet. almost without you being aware of it it opens windows to the truth that lies within and beyond the boundaries of cinema itself.\",\"273\":\"This is a tour de force around a family's quest for that better future amidst sheer poverty. The film's success is not limited only to realistic depiction of human condition in early 20th century Bengal, but it brings up the triumph of human spirit, love and affection in spite of utter struggle in the most poignant way that one may think. Anybody remotely connected with movie making should also watch APARAJITO AND APUR SANSAR, to complete the experience, and off course to understand the art and craft of cinematic expression from the Maestro. No doubt it ranks in top 100 movie list from Time magazine, not to speak of almost all Indian publications connected with films rate this one as THE MOVIE.\",\"274\":\"The real show-stealer of this masterpiece is the 85-year-old lady Takrun (played by Chunibala Devi) - never have I seen such a poignant and natural performer. The smile of gratitude she gives to her niece in the scene where she attempts to drink a sip of water is worth the whole movie!\",\"275\":\"It is one of the classic hits of Indian cinema...Everything is perfect from screenplay, cinematography, art direction, sound, light....And to top it up my favorite directors magic touch.....SO simple yet a master piece....My love towards Satyajit Ray started from this movie followed by his many master strokes...\",\"276\":\".... close.No character development and no plot.Just the daily life of a poor family, where things go from bad to worse.The acting and cinematography is decent, but they could have just taken a camera to any poor village and recorded a random family.Not ever gonna watch it again.\",\"277\":\"It's shocking to think this was made for nearly nothing. The cinematography, acting and writing is really top class. The film does have plenty of faults to but it's still a masterpiece. If you've not seen pather panchali then you really should.\",\"278\":\"Pather panchali is an exquisite amalgamation of art and humanity at it's peak of simplicity. The story is human at its best and yet we find the drama so engaging that we see the bits of our lives in them. Being a story of a family living in a rural village and the hardship they have to go through because of the poverty and unemployment ,it skins down the human emotions of the character at it's naked best and hence the whole plot seems so universal. The camera does the talking here more than any dialogue of the film the way the staging is done and kudos to the man behind The lens Subatra Mitra owing to the fact that he has never filmed a movie prior to this work I'll have to say he does a tremendous job technically as well as artistically the performances are outstanding . The actor seem like they were made for the very particular role they play and the touch of classical score scored by Mr Ravi Shankar himself does the defining work of inducing emotions in each scene. The music ,the camera ,the staging and the actors feel so connected u cannot hold them apart from each other. This is true art of cinema and Ray proves why he is considered the master filmmaker.\",\"279\":\"Just a iconic film.. by legend Satyajit Ray..There are no comparison in the world with this film
